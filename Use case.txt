Use case examples for the AI Agent System:

Use case 1: Web Search and Information Gathering
- Use the google_search tool to find information on any topic
- The agent can search for current news, research topics, or general information
- Example: "Search for the latest AI developments in 2025"

Use case 2: API Integration
- Use the custom_api tool to interact with external services
- The agent can call custom endpoints and process responses
- Example: "Call the summarization API with this text data"

Use case 3: Multi-step Workflows
- Combine multiple tools in sequence to accomplish complex tasks
- The agent can plan and execute multi-step workflows automatically
- Example: "Search for information about X, then summarize the findings using the API"

The agent system is designed to be flexible and extensible by adding more tools to the tools.json configuration file.
