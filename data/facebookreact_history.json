      "message": "[compiler] Improve merging of scopes that invalidate together (#34049)\n\nWe try to merge consecutive reactive scopes that will always invalidate\ntogether, but there's one common case that isn't handled.\n\n```js\nconst y = [[x]];\n```\n\nHere we'll create two consecutive scopes for the inner and outer array\nexpressions. Because the input to the second scope is a temporary,\nthey'll merge into one scope.\n\nBut if we name the inner array, the merging stops:\n\n```js\nconst array = [x];\nconst y = [array];\n```\n\nThis is because the merging logic checks if all the dependencies of the\nsecond scope are outputs of the first scope, but doesn't account for\nrenaming due to LoadLocal/StoreLocal. The fix is to track these\ntemporaries.\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

Since then we've continued to see examples that\nmotivate this mode, so here we're fixing it up to prepare to enable by\ndefault. It now works as follows:\n\n* If we find a property load or property store where both a) the\nobject's name is ref-like (`ref` or `-Ref`) and b) the property is\n`current`, we infer the object itself as a ref and the value of the\nproperty as a ref value. Originally the feature only detected property\nloads, not stores.\n* Inferred refs are not considered stable (this is a change from the\noriginal implementation). The only way to get a stable ref is by calling\n`useRef()`. We've seen issues with assuming refs are stable.\n\nWith this change, cases like the following now correctly error:\n\n```js\nfunction Foo(props) {\n  const fooRef = props.fooRef;\n  fooRef.current = true;\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot modify ref in render\n}\n```\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

This happens because one of\nthe functions passed to a hook clearly mutates a ref  except that we\ntry to ignore mutations of refs! The problem in this case is that the\n`const ref = ...` was getting converted to a context variable since the\nref is accessed in a function before its declaration. We don't infer\ntypes for context variables at all, and our ref handling is based on\ntypes, so we failed to ignore this ref mutation.\n\nThe fix is to recognize that `StoreLocal const ...` is a special case:\nthe variable may be referenced in code before the declaration, but at\nruntime it's either a TDZ error or the variable will have the type from\nthe declaration.

      "message": "[compiler] Fix for edge cases of mutation of potentially frozen values (#33984)\n\nFixes two related cases of mutation of potentially frozen values.\n\nThe first is method calls on frozen values. Previously, we modeled\nunknown function calls as potentially aliasing their receiver+args into\nthe return value. If the receiver or argument were known to be frozen,\nthen we would downgrade the `Alias` effect into an `ImmutableCapture`.\nHowever, within a function expression it's possible to call a function\nusing a frozen value as an argument (that gets `Alias`-ed into the\nreturn) but where we don't have the context locally to know that the\nvalue is frozen.\n\nThis results in cases like this:\n\n```js\nconst frozen = useContext(...);\nuseEffect(() => {\n  frozen.method().property = true;\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot mutate frozen value\n}, [...]);\n```\n\nWithin the function we would infer:\n\n```\nt0 = MethodCall ...\n  Create t0 = mutable\n  Alias t0 <- frozen\nt1 = PropertyStore ...\n  Mutate t0\n```\n\nAnd then transitively infer the function expression as having a `Mutate\n'frozen'` effect, which when evaluated against the outer context\n(`frozen` is frozen) is an error.\n\nThe fix is to model unknown function calls as _maybe_ aliasing their\nreceiver/args in the return, and then considering mutations of a\nmaybe-aliased value to only be a conditional mutation of the source:\n\n\n```\nt0 = MethodCall ...\n  Create t0 = mutable\n  MaybeAlias t0 <- frozen // maybe alias now\nt1 = PropertyStore ...\n  Mutate t0\n```\n\nThen, the `Mutate t0` turns into a `MutateConditional 'frozen'`, which\njust gets ignored when we process the outer context.\n\nThe second, related fix is for known mutation of phis that may be a\nfrozen value. The previous inference model correctly recorded these as\nerrors, the new model does not. We now correctly report a validation\nerror for this case in the new model.\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

But it'll also be used for many new links like stacks.\nIf this new option is configured, and this is a local file then this is\nopened directly in the external editor. Otherwise it fallbacks to open\nin the Sources tab or whatever the standalone or inline is configured to\nuse.\n\n<img width=\"453\" height=\"252\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-24 at 4 09 09슗M\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04cae170-dd30-4485-a9ee-e8fe1612978e\"\n/>\n\nI prominently surface this option in the Source pane to make it\ndiscoverable.\n\n<img width=\"588\" height=\"144\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-24 at 4 03 48슗M\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f3a7da9-2fae-4b5b-90ec-769c5a9c5361\"\n/>\n\nWhen this is configured, the \"Open in Editor\" is hidden since that's\njust the default. I plan on deprecating this button to avoid having the\ntwo buttons going forward.\n\nNotably there's one exception where this doesn't work. When you click an\nAction or Event listener it takes you to the Sources tab and you have to\nopen in editor from there. That's because we use the `inspect()`\nmechanism instead of extracting the source location. That's because we\ncan't do the \"throw trick\" since these can have side-effects. The Chrome\ndebugger protocol would solve this but it pops up an annoying dialog. We\ncould maybe only attach the debugger only for that case. Especially if\nthe dialog disappears before you focus on the browser again.",

      "message": "[compiler][rfc] Enable more validations in playground. (#33777)\n\nThis is mostly to kick off conversation, i think we should go with a\nmodified version of the implemented approach that i'll describe here.\n\nThe playground currently serves two roles. The primary one we think\nabout is for verifying compiler output. We use it for this sometimes,\nand developers frequently use it for this, including to send us repros\nif they have a potential bug. The second mode is to help developers\nlearn about React. Part of that includes learning how to use React\ncorrectly  where it's helpful to see feedback about problematic code \nand also to understand what kind of tools we provide compared to other\nframeworks, to make an informed choice about what tools they want to\nuse.\n\nCurrently we primarily think about the first role, but I think we should\nemphasize the second more. In this PR i'm doing the worst of both:\nenabling all the validations used by both the compiler and the linter by\ndefault. This means that code that would actually compile can fail with\nvalidations, which isn't great.\n\nWhat I think we should actually do is compile twice, one in\n\"compilation\" mode and once in \"linter\" mode, and combine the results as\nfollows:\n* If \"compilation\" mode succeeds, show the compiled output _and_ any\nlinter errors.\n* If \"compilation\" mode fails, show only the compilation mode failures.\n\nWe should also distinguish which case it is when we show errors:\n\"Compilation succeeded\", \"Compilation succeeded with linter errors\",\n\"Compilation failed\".\n\nThis lets developers continue to verify compiler output, while also\nturning the playground into a much more useful tool for learning React.\nThoughts?\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

However, many\ncases of IIFEs are due to inlining of manual `useMemo()`, and these\ncases often have only a single return statement. Here, the output is\ncleaner if we avoid the temporary and label - so that's what we do in\nthis PR.\n\nNote that the most complex part of the change is actually around\nValidatePreserveExistingMemo - we have some logic to track the IIFE\ntemporary reassignmetns which needs to be updated to handle the simpler\nversion of inlining.\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

      "message": "[Flight] Optimize Async Stack Collection (#33727)\n\nWe need to optimize the collection of debug info for dev mode. This is\nan incredibly hot path since it instruments all I/O and Promises in the\napp.\n\nThese optimizations focus primarily on the collection of stack traces.\nThey are expensive to collect because we need to eagerly collect the\nstacks since they can otherwise cause memory leaks. We also need to do\nsome of the processing of them up front. We also end up only using a few\nof them in the end but we don't know which ones we'll use.\n\nThe first compromise here is that I now only collect the stacks of\n\"awaits\" if they were in a specific request's render. In some cases it's\nuseful to collect them even outside of this if they're part of a\nsequence that started early. I still collect stacks for the created\nPromises outside of this though which can still provide some context.\n\nThe other optimization to awaits, is that since we'll only use the inner\nmost one that had an await directly in userspace, we can stop collecting\nstacks on a chain of awaits after we find one. This requires a quick\nfilter on a single callsite to determine. Since we now only collect\nstacks from awaits that belongs to a specific Request we can use that\nrequest's specific filter option. Technically this might not be quite\ncorrect if that same thing ends up deduped across Requests but that's an\nedge case.\n\nAdditionally, I now stop collecting stack for I/O nodes. They're almost\nalways superseded by the Promise that wraps them anyway. Even if you\nwrite mostly Promise free code, you'll likely end up with a Promise at\nthe root of the component eventually anyway and then you end up using\nits stack anyway. You have to really contort the code to end up with\nzero Promises at which point it's not very useful anyway. At best it's\nmaybe mostly useful for giving a name to the I/O when the rest is just\nstuff like `new Promise`.\n\nHowever, a possible alternative optimization could be to *only* collect\nthe stack of spawned I/O and not the stack of Promises. The issue with\nPromises (not awaits) is that we never know what will end up resolving\nthem in the end when they're created so we have to always eagerly\ncollect stacks. This could be an issue when you have a lot of\nabstractions that end up not actually be related to I/O at all. The\nissue with collecting stacks only for I/O is that the actual I/O can be\npooled or batched so you end up not having the stack when the conceptual\nstart of each operation within the batch started. Which is why I decided\nto keep the Promise stack.",

This actually doesn't work with the current\nsetup, because we don't allow the container to overflow, so basically\ndeeply nested elements will go off the screen.\n\nWith these changes, we completely change the approach:\n- The layout will be static and it will have a constant indentation that\nwill always be preserved.\n- The container will allow overflows, so users will be able to scroll\nhorizontally and vertically.\n- We will implement automatic horizontal and vertical scrolls, if\nselected element is not in a viewport.\n- New: added vertical delimiter that can be used for simpler visual\nnavigation.\n\n## Demo\n### Current public release\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58645d42-c6b8-408b-b76f-95fb272f2e1e\n\n### With https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33517 \n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845285c8-5a01-4739-bcd7-ffc089e771bf\n\n### This PR\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72086b84-8d84-4626-94b3-e22e114e028e",

I'm instead using a polyfill using\ntouch events on iOS.\n\nSafari seems set to [release ScrollTimeline\nsoon](https://webkit.org/blog/16993/news-from-wwdc25-web-technology-coming-this-fall-in-safari-26-beta/).\nUnfortunately it's not really what you'd expect.\n\nFirst of all, [it's not running in sync with the\nscroll](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288402) which is kind of\nits main point. Instead, it is running at 60fps and out of sync with the\nscroll just like JS. In fact, it is worse than JS because with JS you\ncan at least spawn CSS animations that run at 120fps. So our polyfill\ncan respond to touches at 60fps while gesturing and then run at 120fps\nupon release. That's better than with ScrollTimeline.\n\nSecond, [there's a bug which interrupts scrolling if you start a\nViewTransition](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288795) when the\nelement is being removed as part of that. The element can still respond\nto touches so in a polyfill this isn't an issue. But it essentially\nmakes it useless to use ScrollTimeline with swipe-away gestures.\n\nSo we're better off in every scenario by not using it.\n\nThe UA detection is a bit unfortunate. Not sure if there's something\nmore specific but we also had to do a UA detection for Chrome for View\nTransitions. Those are the only two we have in all of React.\n\n\n![safarimeme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ca9eba-489e-4ade-b462-2ffeee3a470c)",

That's because our cycle resolution only\nworks if the cyclic future reference is created synchronously within the\nparsing path of the child.\n\nI haven't been able to construct a normal scenario where this would\nbreak. So this doesn't fail any tests. However, I can construct it with\ndebug info since those are eagerly evaluated. It's also a prerequisite\nif the debug data can come out of order, like if it's on a different\nstream.\n\nThe fix here is to make all the internal dependencies in the \"listener\"\nlist into introspectable objects instead of closures. That way we can\ntraverse the list of dependencies of a blocked reference to see if it\nends up in a cycle and therefore skip the reference.\n\nIt would be nice to address this once and for all to be more resilient\nto server changes, but I'm not sure if it's worth this complexity and\nthe extra CPU cost of tracing the dependencies.

I\nknowingly used a really simple (dumb) approach in\nInferFunctionExpressionAliasingEffects but it worked surprisingly well\non a ton of code. However, investigating during the sync I saw that we\nthe algorithm was literally running out of memory, or crashing from\narrays that exceeded the maximum capacity. We were accumluating data\nflow in a way that could lead to lists of data flow captures compounding\non themselves and growing very large very quickly. Plus, we were\nincorrectly recording some data flow, leading to cases where we reported\nfalse positive \"can't mutate frozen value\" for example.\n\nSo I went back to the drawing board. InferMutationAliasingRanges already\nbuilds up a data flow graph which it uses to figure out what values\nwould be affected by mutations of other values, and update mutable\nranges. Well, the key question that we really want to answer for\ninferring a function expression's aliasing effects is which values\nalias/capture where. Per the docs I wrote up, we only have to record\nsuch aliasing _if they are observable via mutations_. So, lightbulb:\nsimulate mutations of the params, free variables, and return of the\nfunction expression and see which params/free-vars would be affected!\nThat's what we do now, giving us precise information about which such\nvalues alias/capture where. When the \"into\" is a param/context-var we\nuse Capture, iwhen the destination is the return we use Alias to be\nconservative.\n\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

      "message": "[Flight] Add Debug Channel option for stateful connection to the backend in DEV (#33627)\n\nThis adds plumbing for opening a stream from the Flight Client to the\nFlight Server so it can ask for more data on-demand. In this mode, the\nFlight Server keeps the connection open as long as the client is still\nalive and there's more objects to load. It retains any depth limited\nobjects so that they can be asked for later. In this first PR it just\nreleases the object when it's discovered on the server and doesn't\nactually lazy load it yet. That's coming in a follow up.\n\nThis strategy is built on the model that each request has its own\nchannel for this. Instead of some global registry. That ensures that\nreferential identity is preserved within a Request and the Request can\nrefer to previously written objects by reference.\n\nThe fixture implements a WebSocket per request but it doesn't have to be\ndone that way. It can be multiplexed through an existing WebSocket for\nexample. The current protocol is just a Readable(Stream) on the server\nand WritableStream on the client. It could even be sent through a HTTP\nrequest body if browsers implemented full duplex (which they don't).\n\nThis PR only implements the direction of messages from Client to Server.\nHowever, I also plan on adding Debug Channel in the other direction to\nallow debug info (optionally) be sent from Server to Client through this\nchannel instead of through the main RSC request. So the `debugChannel`\noption will be able to take writable or readable or both.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Hendrik Liebau <mail@hendrik-liebau.de>",

The `Response` holds onto all objects that were in that\nresponse since they're needed in case the parsed content ends up\nreferring to an existing object.

I do this\nby storing the WeakRefs but to ensure that the Promise doesn't get\ngarbage collected, I keep a WeakMap of Promise to the Promise that it\ndepended on. This lets the VM still clean up any Promise chains that\nhave leaves that are cleaned up. So this makes Promises live until the\nlast Promise downstream is done. At that point we can go back up the\nchain to read the values out of them.\n\nAdditionally, to get the best possible value we don't want to get a\nPromise that's used by internals of a third-party function. We want the\nvalue that the first party gets to observe. To do this I had to change\nthe logic for which \"await\" to use, to be the one that is the first\nawait that happened in user space. It's not enough that the await has\nany first party at all on the stack - it has to be the very first frame.\nThis is a little sketchy because it relies on the `.then()` call or\n`await` call not having any third party wrappers. But it gives the best\nobject since it hides all the internals. For example when you call\n`fetch()` we now log that actual `Response` object.",

Roughly speaking the\nscenario is:\n\n* Create a mutable object `x`\n* Extract part of that object and pass it to a hook/jsx so that _part_\nbecomes frozen\n* Mutate `x`, even indirectly.\n\nIn the old model we can still independently memoize the value from the\nmiddle step, since we assume that part of the larger value is not\nchanging. In the new model, the mutation from the later step effectively\noverrides the freeze effect in step 2, and considers the value to have\nchanged later anyway.\n\nWe've already rolled out and vetted the previous behavior, confirming\nthat the heuristic of \"that part of the mutable object is fozen now\" is\ngenerally safe.

However, there was\na bug in that logic: InferReactiveScopeVariables makes all the\nidentifiers in a scope point to the same mutable range instance. That\nmeant that it was possible for a later function expression to indirectly\ncause an earlier function expressions' context variables to get a\nnon-zero mutable range.\n\nThe fix is to not just reset start/end of context var ranges, but assign\na new range instance.

      "message": "Expose cacheSignal() alongside cache() (#33557)\n\nThis was really meant to be there from the beginning. A `cache()`:ed\nentry has a life time. On the server this ends when the render finishes.\nOn the client this ends when the cache of that scope gets refreshed.\n\nWhen a cache is no longer needed, it should be possible to abort any\noutstanding network requests or other resources. That's what\n`cacheSignal()` gives you. It returns an `AbortSignal` which aborts when\nthe cache lifetime is done based on the same execution scope as a\n`cache()`ed function - i.e. `AsyncLocalStorage` on the server or the\nrender scope on the client.\n\n```js\nimport {cacheSignal} from 'react';\nasync function Component() {\n  await fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });\n}\n```\n\nFor `fetch` in particular, a patch should really just do this\nautomatically for you. But it's useful for other resources like database\nconnections.\n\nAnother reason it's useful to have a `cacheSignal()` is to ignore any\nerrors that might have triggered from the act of being aborted. This is\njust a general useful JavaScript pattern if you have access to a signal:\n\n```js\nasync function getData(id, signal) {\n  try {\n     await queryDatabase(id, { signal });\n  } catch (x) {\n     if (!signal.aborted) {\n       logError(x); // only log if it's a real error and not due to cancellation\n     }\n     return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis just gets you a convenient way to get to it without drilling\nthrough so a more idiomatic code in React might look something like.\n\n```js\nimport {cacheSignal} from \"react\";\n\nasync function getData(id) {\n  try {\n     await queryDatabase(id);\n  } catch (x) {\n     if (!cacheSignal()?.aborted) {\n       logError(x);\n     }\n     return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf it's called outside of a React render, we normally treat any cached\nfunctions as uncached. They're not an error call. They can still load\ndata. It's just not cached. This is not like an aborted signal because\nthen you couldn't issue any requests. It's also not like an infinite\nabort signal because it's not actually cached forever. Therefore,\n`cacheSignal()` returns `null` when called outside of a React render\nscope.\n\nNotably the `signal` option passed to `renderToReadableStream` in both\nSSR (Fizz) and RSC (Flight Server) is not the same instance that comes\nout of `cacheSignal()`. If you abort the `signal` passed in, then the\n`cacheSignal()` is also aborted with the same reason. However, the\n`cacheSignal()` can also get aborted if the render completes\nsuccessfully or fatally errors during render - allowing any outstanding\nwork that wasn't used to clean up. In the future we might also expand on\nthis to give different\n[`TaskSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TaskSignal)\nto different scopes to pass different render or network priorities.\n\nOn the client version of `\"react\"` this exposes a noop (both for\nFiber/Fizz) due to `disableClientCache` flag but it's exposed so that\nyou can write shared code.",

      "message": "[devtools] Added minimum indent size to Component Tree (#33517)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe devtools Components tab's component tree view currently has a\nbehavior where the indentation of each level of the tree scales based on\nthe available width of the view.

      "message": "[Flight] Track Debug Info from Synchronously Unwrapped Promises (#33485)\n\nStacked on #33482.\n\nThere's a flaw with getting information from the execution context of\nthe ping. For the soft-deprecated \"throw a promise\" technique, this is a\nbit unreliable because you could in theory throw the same one multiple\ntimes. Similarly, a more fundamental flaw with that API is that it\ndoesn't allow for tracking the information of Promises that are already\nsynchronously able to resolve.\n\nThis stops tracking the async debug info in the case of throwing a\nPromise and only when you render a Promise. That means some loss of data\nbut we should just warn for throwing a Promise anyway.\n\nInstead, this also adds support for tracking `use()`d thenables and\nforwarding `_debugInfo` from then. This is done by extracting the info\nfrom the Promise after the fact instead of in the resolve so that it\nonly happens once at the end after the pings are done.\n\nThis also supports passing the same Promise in multiple places and\ntracking the debug info at each location, even if it was already\ninstrumented with a synchronous value by the time of the second use.",

This gets popped by `popTreeContext` in `completeWork`.\nNormally `completeWork` returns its own `Fiber` again if it wants to do\na second pass which will call `pushTreeFork` again in the next pass.\nHowever, `SuspenseList` doesn't return itself, it returns the next child\nto work on.\n\nThe fix is to keep track of the count and push it again it when we\nreturn the next child to attempt.\n\nThere are still some outstanding issues with hydration. Like the\nbackwards test still has the wrong behavior in it because it hydrates\nbackwards and so it picks up the DOM nodes in reverse order.\n`tail=\"hidden\"` also doesn't work correctly.\n\nThere's also another issue with `useId` and `AsyncIterable` in\nSuspenseList when there's an unknown number of children. We don't\nsupport those showing one at a time yet though so it's not an issue yet.\nTo fix it we need to add variable total count to the `useId` algorithm.\nE.g. by falling back to varint encoding.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Rick Hanlon <rickhanlonii@fb.com>\nCo-authored-by: Ricky <rickhanlonii@gmail.com>",

This is the default pattern for event handlers in\nreact-native.\nHowever, there are reasons for why you might want to opt-out of this\nbehavior, and instead, pass along the actual function as the prop.\nRight now, there is no way to do this, and props that are functions\nalways get set to `true`.\nThe `ViewConfig` attributes already have the API for a `process`\nfunction. I simply moved the check for the process function up, so if a\nViewConfig's prop attribute configured a process function this is always\ncalled first.\nThis provides an API to opt out of the default behavior. \n\nThis is the accompanied PR for react-native:\n\n- https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/48777\n\n## How did you test this change?\n\n<!--\nDemonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and\ntheir output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user\ninterface.\nHow exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to\nsolve?\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\n-->\n\nI modified the code manually in a template react-native app and\nconfirmed its working. This is a code path you only need in very special\ncases, thus it's a bit hard to provide a test for this. I recorded a\nvideo where you can see that the changes are active and the prop is\nbeing passed as native value.\n\nFor this I created a custom native component with a view config that\nlooked like this:\n\n```js\nconst viewConfig = {\n  uiViewClassName: 'CustomView',\n  bubblingEventTypes: {},\n  directEventTypes: {},\n  validAttributes: {\n    nativeProp: {\n      process: (nativeProp) => {\n\t\t// Identity function that simply returns the prop function callback\n        // to opt out of this prop being set to `true` as its a function\n        return nativeProp\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/493534b2-a508-4142-a760-0b1b24419e19\n\nAdditionally I made sure that this doesn't conflict with any existing\nview configs in react native. In general, this shouldn't be a breaking\nchange, as for existing view configs it didn't made a difference if you\nsimply set `myProp: true` or `myProp: { process: () => {...} }` because\nas soon as it was detected that the prop is a function the config\nwouldn't be used (which is what this PR fixes).\nProbably everyone, including the react-native core components use\n`myProp: true` for callback props, so this change should be fine.",

      "message": "[Flight] Clarify Semantics for Awaiting Cached Data (#33438)\n\nTechnically the async call graph spans basically all the way back to the\nstart of the app potentially, but we don't want to include everything.\nSimilarly we don't want to include everything from previous components\nin every child component. So we need some heuristics for filtering out\ndata.\n\nWe roughly want to be able to inspect is what might contribute to a\nSuspense loading sequence even if it didn't this time e.g. due to a race\ncondition.\n\nOne flaw with the previous approach was that awaiting a cached promise\nin a sibling that happened to finish after another sibling would be\nexcluded. However, in a different race condition that might end up being\nused so I wanted to include an empty \"await\" in that scenario to have\nsome association from that component.\n\nHowever, for data that resolved fully before the request even started,\nit's a little different. This can be things that are part of the start\nup sequence of the app or externally cached data. We decided that this\nshould be excluded because it doesn't contribute to the loading sequence\nin the expected scenario. I.e. if it's cached. Things that end up being\ncache misses would still be included. If you want to test externally\ncached data misses, then it's up to you or the framework to simulate\nthose. E.g. by dropping the cache. This also helps free up some noise\nsince static / cached data can be excluded in visualizations.\n\nI also apply this principle to forwarding debug info. If you reuse a\ncached RSC payload, then the Server Component render time and its awaits\ngets clamped to the caller as if it has zero render/await time. The I/O\nentry is still back dated but if it was fully resolved before we started\nthen it's completely excluded.",

So we should make sure\nthat were we create the JSX has no owner to simulate this.\n\nWhen we then parse a null owner on the receiving side, we replace its\nowner/stack with the owner/stack of the call to `createFrom...` to\nconnect them.

      "message": "[Fizz] Support deeply nested Suspense inside fallback (#33467)\n\nWhen deeply nested Suspense boundaries inside a fallback of another\nboundary resolve it is possible to encounter situations where you either\nattempt to flush an aborted Segment or you have a boundary without any\nroot segment. We intended for both of these conditions to be impossible\nto arrive at legitimately however it turns out in this situation you\ncan. The fix is two-fold\n\n1. allow flushing aborted segments by simply skipping them. This does\nremove some protection against future misconfiguraiton of React because\nit is no longer an invariant that you hsould never attempt to flush an\naborted segment but there are legitimate cases where this can come up\nand simply omitting the segment is fine b/c we know that the user will\nnever observe this. A semantically better solution would be to avoid\nflushing boudaries inside an unneeded fallback but to do this we would\nneed to track all boundaries inside a fallback or create back pointers\nwhich add to memory overhead and possibly make GC harder to do\nefficiently. By flushing extra we're maintaining status quo and only\nsuffer in performance not with broken semantics.\n\n2. when queuing completed segments allow for queueing aborted segments\nand if we are eliding the enqueued segment allow for child segments that\nare errored to be enqueued too. This will mean that we can maintain the\ninvariant that a boundary must have a root segment the first time we\nflush it, it just might be aborted (see point 1 above).\n\nThis change has two seemingly similar test cases to exercise this fix.\nThe reason we need both is that when you have empty segments you hit\ndifferent code paths within Fizz and so each one (without this fix)\ntriggers a different error pathway.\n\nThis change also includes a fix to our tests where we were not\nappropriately setting CSPnonce back to null at the start of each test so\nin some contexts scripts would not run for some tests",

If you're already pretty good, then a slight delay won't suddenly\nmake you rank in a completely different category. Similarly, if you're\nalready pretty bad then a slight delay won't make it suddenly way worse.\nIt's still in the same realm. It's just one weight of many. I don't\nthink this will make a meaningful practical impact and if it does,\nthat's probably a bug in the weights that will get fixed.\n\nHowever, because there's a race to try to \"make everything green\" in\nterms of web vitals, if you go from green to yellow only because of some\nthrottling or suspensey images, it can feel bad. Therefore this\nimplements a heuristic where if the only reason we'd miss a specific\ntarget is because of throttling or suspensey images, then we shorten the\ntimeout to hit the metric. This is a worse user experience because it\ncan lead to extra flashing but feeling good about \"green\" matters too.\n\nIf you then have another reveal that happens to be the largest\ncontentful paint after that, then that's throttled again so that it\ndoesn't become flashy after that. If you've already missed the deadline\nthen you're not going to hit your metric target anyway. It can affect\naverage but not median.\n\nThis is mainly about LCP. It doesn't affect FCP since that doesn't have\na throttle. If your LCP is the same as your FCP then it also doesn't\nmatter.\n\nWe assume that `performance.now()`'s zero point starts at the \"start of\nthe navigation\" which makes this simple. Even if we used the\n`PerformanceNavigationTiming` API it would just tell us the same thing.\n\nThis only implements for Fizz since these metrics tend to currently only\nby tracked for initial loads, but with soft navs tracking we could\nconsider implementing the same for Fiber throttles.",

      "message": "[Flight] Forward debugInfo from awaited instrumented Promises (#33415)\n\nStacked on #33403.\n\nWhen a Promise is coming from React such as when it's passed from\nanother environment, we should forward the debug information from that\nenvironment. We already do that when rendered as a child.\n\nThis makes it possible to also `await promise` and have the information\nfrom that instrumented promise carry through to the next render.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because the current protocol is that we have to\nread it from the Promise after it resolves so it has time to be assigned\nto the promise. `async_hooks` doesn't pass us the instance (even though\nit has it) when it gets resolved so we need to keep it around. However,\nwe have to be very careful because if we get this wrong it'll cause a\nmemory leak since we retain things by `asyncId` and then manually listen\nfor `destroy()` which can only be called once a Promise is GC:ed, which\nit can't be if we retain it. We have to therefore use a `WeakRef` in\ncase it never resolves, and then read the `_debugInfo` when it resolves.\nWe could maybe install a setter or something instead but that's also\nheavy.\n\nThe other issues is that we don't use native Promises in\nReactFlightClient so our instrumented promises aren't picked up by the\n`async_hooks` implementation and so we never get a handle to our\nthenable instance. To solve this we can create a native wrapper only in\nDEV.",

      "message": "[Flight] Track Awaits on I/O as Debug Info (#33388)\n\nThis lets us track what data each Server Component depended on. This\nwill be used by Performance Track and React DevTools.\n\nWe use Node.js `async_hooks`. This has a number of downside. It is\nNode.js specific so this feature is not available in other runtimes\nuntil something equivalent becomes available. It's [discouraged by\nNode.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html#async-hooks). It's\nalso slow which makes this approach only really viable in development\nmode. At least with stack traces. However, it's really the only solution\nthat gives us the data that we need.\n\nThe [Diagnostic\nChannel](https://nodejs.org/api/diagnostics_channel.html) API is not\nsufficient. Not only is many Node.js built-in APIs missing but all\nlibraries like databases are also missing. Were as `async_hooks` covers\npretty much anything async in the Node.js ecosystem.\n\nHowever, even if coverage was wider it's not actually showing the\ninformation we want. It's not enough to show the low level I/O that is\nhappening because that doesn't provide the context. We need the stack\ntrace in user space code where it was initiated and where it was\nawaited. It's also not each low level socket operation that we want to\nsurface but some higher level concept which can span a sequence of I/O\noperations but as far as user space is concerned.\n\nTherefore this solution is anchored on stack traces and ignore listing\nto determine what the interesting span is. It is somewhat\nPromise-centric (and in particular async/await) because it allows us to\nmodel an abstract span instead of just random I/O. Async/await points\nare also especially useful because this allows Async Stacks to show the\nfull sequence which is not supported by random callbacks. However, if no\nPromises are involved we still to our best to show the stack causing\nplain I/O callbacks.\n\nAdditionally, we don't want to track all possible I/O. For example,\nside-effects like logging that doesn't affect the rendering performance\ndoesn't need to be included. We only want to include things that\nactually block the rendering output. We also need to track which data\nblocks each component so that we can track which data caused a\nparticular subtree to suspend.\n\nWe can do this using `async_hooks` because we can track the graph of\nwhat resolved what and then spawned what.\n\nTo track what suspended what, something has to resolve. Therefore it\nneeds to run to completion before we can show what it was suspended on.\nSo something that never resolves, won't be tracked for example.\n\nWe use the `async_hooks` in `ReactFlightServerConfigDebugNode` to build\nup an `ReactFlightAsyncSequence` graph that collects the stack traces\nfor basically all I/O and Promises allocated in the whole app. This is\npretty heavy, especially the stack traces, but it's because we don't\nknow which ones we'll need until they resolve. We don't materialize the\nstacks until we need them though.\n\nOnce they end up pinging the Flight runtime, we collect which current\nexecuting task that pinged the runtime and then log the sequence that\nled up until that runtime into the RSC protocol. Currently we only\ninclude things that weren't already resolved before we started rendering\nthis task/component, so that we don't log the entire history each time.\n\nEach operation is split into two parts. First a `ReactIOInfo` which\nrepresents an I/O operation and its start/end time. Basically the start\npoint where it was start. This is basically represents where you called\n`new Promise()` or when entering an `async function` which has an\nimplied Promise. It can be started in a different component than where\nit's awaited and it can be awaited in multiple places. Therefore this is\nglobal information and not associated with a specific Component.\n\nThe second part is `ReactAsyncInfo`. This represents where this I/O was\n`await`:ed or `.then()` called. This is associated with a point in the\ntree (usually the Promise that's a direct child of a Component). Since\nyou can have multiple different I/O awaited in a sequence technically it\nforms a dependency graph but to simplify the model these awaits as\nflattened into the `ReactDebugInfo` list. Basically it contains each\nawait in a sequence that affected this part from unblocking.\n\nThis means that the same `ReactAsyncInfo` can appear in mutliple\ncomponents if they all await the same `ReactIOInfo` but the same Promise\nonly appears once.\n\nPromises that are only resolved by other Promises or immediately are not\nconsidered here. Only if they're resolved by an I/O operation. We pick\nthe Promise basically on the border between user space code and ignored\nlisted code (`node_modules`) to pick the most specific span but abstract\nenough to not give too much detail irrelevant to the current audience.\nSimilarly, the deepest `await` in user space is marked as the relevant\n`await` point.\n\nThis feature is only available in the `node` builds of React. Not if you\nuse the `edge` builds inside of Node.js.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Sebastian \"Sebbie\" Silbermann <silbermann.sebastian@gmail.com>",

Because if one boundary downloads all\nits html and then issues a complete instruction it'll appear before the\nothers while streaming in. What we actually want is to reveal them all\nin a single batch.\n\nThis implementation takes a short cut by unblocking the rows in\n`flushPartialBoundary`. That ensures that all the segments of every\nboundary has a chance to flush before we start emitting any of the\ncomplete boundary instructions. Once the last one unblocks, all the\ncomplete boundary instructions are queued. Ideally this would be a\nsingle `<script>` tag so that they can't be split up even if we get a\nchunk containing some of them.\n\n~A downside of this approach is that we always outline these boundaries.\nWe could inline them if they all complete before the parent flushes.\nE.g. by checking if the row is blocked only by its own boundaries and if\nall the boundaries would fit without getting outlined, then we can\ninline them all at once.~ I went ahead and did this because it solves an\nissue with `renderToString` where it doesn't support the script runtime\nso it can only handle this if inlined.",

We could\nmodel them as comments like we do with other virtual nodes like Suspense\nand Activity. However, that doesn't let us target them with\nquerySelector and CSS (for no-JS transitions). We also don't have to\nmodel every ViewTransition since not every combination can happen using\nonly the server runtime. So instead this collapses `<ViewTransition>`\nand applies the configuration to the inner DOM nodes.\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition name=\"hi\">\n  <div />\n  <div />\n</ViewTransition>\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```html\n<div vt-name=\"hi\" vt-update=\"auto\"></div>\n<div vt-name=\"hi_1\" vt-update=\"auto\"></div>\n```\n\nI use `vt-` prefix as opposed to `data-` to keep these virtual\nattributes away from user specific ones but we're effectively claiming\nthis namespace.\n\nThere are four triggers `vt-update`, `vt-enter`, `vt-exit` and\n`vt-share`. The server resolves which ones might apply to this DOM node.\nThe value represents the class name (after resolving\nview-transition-type mappings) or `\"auto\"` if no specific class name is\nneeded but this is still a trigger.\n\nThe value can also be `\"none\"`. This is different from missing because\nfor example an `vt-update=\"none\"` will block mutations inside it from\ntriggering the boundary where as a missing `vt-update` would bubble up\nto be handled by a parent.\n\n`vt-name` is technically only necessary when `vt-share` is specified to\nfind a pair. However, since an explicit name can also be used to target\nspecific CSS selectors, we include it even for other cases.\n\nWe want to exclude as many of these annotations as possible.\n\n`vt-enter` can only affect the first DOM node inside a Suspense\nboundary's content since the reveal would cause it to enter but nothing\ndeeper inside. Similarly `vt-exit` can only affect the first DOM node\ninside a fallback. So for every other case we can exclude them. (For\nfuture MPA ViewTransitions of the whole document it might also be\nsomething we annotate to children inside the `<body>` as well.) Ideally\nwe'd only include `vt-enter` for Suspense boundaries that actually\nflushed a fallback but since we prepare all that content earlier it's\nhard to know.\n\n`vt-share` can be anywhere inside an fallback or content. Technically we\ndon't have to include it outside the root most Suspense boundary or for\nboundaries that are inlined into the root shell. However, this is tricky\nto detect. It would also not be correct for future MPA ViewTransitions\nbecause in that case the shared scenario can affect anything in the two\ndocuments so it needs to be in every node everywhere which is\neffectively what we do. If a `share` class is specified but it has no\nexplicit name, we can exclude it since it can't match anything.\n\n`vt-update` is only necessary if something below or a sibling might\nupdate like a Suspense boundary. However, since we don't know when\nrendering a segment if it'll later asynchronously add a Suspense\nboundary later we have to assume that anywhere might have a child. So\nthese are always included. We collapse to use the inner most one when\ndirectly nested though since that's the one that ends up winning.\n\nThere are some weird edge cases that can't be fully modeled by the lack\nof virtual nodes.",

This tracks the lanes that currently need\nan indicator to either start or remain going until this lane commits.\n2) Track mutations during any commit. We use the same hook that view\ntransitions use here but instead of tracking it just per view transition\nscope, we also track a global boolean for the whole root.\n3) If a sync/default commit had any mutations, then we clear the\nindicator lane for the `currentEventTransitionLane`. This requires that\nthe lane is still active while we do these commits. See #33159. In other\nwords, a sync update gets associated with the current transition and it\nis assumed to be rendering the loading state for that corresponding\ntransition so we don't need a default indicator for this lane.\n4) At the end of `processRootScheduleInMicrotask`, right before we're\nabout to enter a new \"event transition lane\" scope, it is no longer\npossible to render any more loading states for the current transition\nlane.

This may be problematic if mutation deletes a subtree,\nin that case `fiber.alternate.stateNode` will retain entire subtree\nuntil next update. In case of image nodes, this means retaining entire\nimages.\n\nSo when React goes from revision A: `<View><View /></View>` to revision\nB: `<View />`, `fiber.alternate.stateNode` will be pointing to Shadow\nNode that represents revision A..\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/076b677e-d152-4763-8c9d-4f923212b424)\n\n\n# Fix\nTo fix this, this PR adds a new feature flag\n`enableEagerAlternateStateNodeCleanup`.

      "message": "feat(compiler): Implement constant propagation for template literals  (#33139)\n\nNew take on #29716\n\n## Summary\nTemplate literals consisting entirely of constant values will be inlined\nto a string literal, effectively replacing the backticks with a double\nquote.\n\nThis is done primarily to make the resulting instruction a string\nliteral, so it can be processed further in constant propatation. So this\nis now correctly simplified to `true`:\n```js\n`` === \"\" // now true\n`a${1}` === \"a1\" // now true\n```\n\nIf a template string literal can only partially be comptime-evaluated,\nit is not that useful for dead code elimination or further constant\nfolding steps and thus, is left as-is in that case. Same is true if the\nliteral contains an array, object, symbol or function.\n\n## How did you test this change?\n\nSee added tests.",

      "message": "[DevTools] Use Popover API for TraceUpdates highlighting (#32614)\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen using React DevTools to highlight component updates, the highlights\nwould sometimes appear behind elements that use the browser's\n[top-layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer)\n(such as `<dialog>` elements or components using the Popover API). This\nmade it difficult to see which components were updating when they were\ninside or behind top-layer elements.\n\nThis PR fixes the issue by using the Popover API to ensure that\nhighlighting appears on top of all content, including elements in the\ntop-layer. The implementation maintains backward compatibility with\nbrowsers that don't support the Popover API.\n\n## How did you test this change?\n\nI tested this change in the following ways:\n\n1. Manually tested in Chrome (which supports the Popover API) with:\n- Created a test application with React components inside `<dialog>`\nelements and custom elements using the Popover API\n- Verified that component highlighting appears above these elements when\nthey update\n- Confirmed that highlighting displays correctly for nested components\nwithin top-layer elements\n\n2. Verified backward compatibility:\n- Tested in browsers without Popover API support to ensure fallback\nbehavior works correctly\n- Confirmed that no errors occur and highlighting still functions as\nbefore\n\n3. Ran the React DevTools test suite:\n   - All tests pass successfully\n   - No regressions were introduced\n\n[demo-page](https://devtools-toplayer-demo.vercel.app/)\n[demo-repo](https://github.com/yongsk0066/devtools-toplayer-demo)\n\n### AS-IS\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2e1281-969f-4f61-82c3-480153916969\n\n### TO-BE\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd52ce35-816c-42f0-819b-0d5d0a8a21e5",

      "message": "[compiler] Fix for uncalled functions that are known-mutable\n\nIf a function captures a mutable value but never gets called, we don't infer a mutable range for that function. This means that we also don't alias the function with its mutable captures.\n\nThis case is tricky, because we don't generally know for sure what is a mutation and what may just be a normal function call. For example:\n\n```js\nhook useFoo() {\n  const x = makeObject();\n  return () => {\n    return readObject(x); // could be a mutation!\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf we pessimistically assume that all such cases are mutations, we'd have to group lots of memo scopes together unnecessarily. However, if there is definitely a mutation:\n\n```js\nhook useFoo(createEntryForKey) {\n  const cache = new WeakMap();\n  return (key) => {\n    let entry = cache.get(key);\n    if (entry == null) {\n      entry = createEntryForKey(key);\n      cache.set(key, entry); // known mutation!\n    }\n    return entry;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen we have to ensure that the function and its mutable captures alias together and end up in the same scope. However, aliasing together isn't enough if the function and operands all have empty mutable ranges (end = start + 1).\n\nThis pass finds function expressions and object methods that have an empty mutable range and known-mutable operands which also don't have a mutable range, and ensures that the function and those operands are aliased together *and* that their ranges are updated to end after the function expression. This is sufficient to ensure that a reactive scope is created for the alias set.\n\nNOTE: The alternative is to reject these cases. If we do that we'd also want to similarly disallow cases like passing a mutable function to a hook.\n\nghstack-source-id: 5d8158246a320e80d8da3f0e395ac1953d8920a2\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33078",

But the error message is really good (nice job mofeiz): the only catch is that in theory the inferred dep could be a temporary that can't trivially be reported to the user.\n\nBut the messages are really useful for quickly verifying why the compiler couldn't preserve memoization. So here we switch to outputting a detailed message about the discrepancy btw inferred/manual deps so long as the inferred dep root is a named variable. I also slightly adjusted the message to handle the case where there is no diagnostic, which can occur if there were no manual deps but the compiler inferred a dependency.\n\nghstack-source-id: 534f6f1fec0855e05e85077eba050eb2ba254ef8\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33095",

      "message": "[Fizz] Batch Suspense Boundary Reveal with Throttle (#33076)\n\nStacked on #33073.\n\nReact semantics is that Suspense boundaries reveal with a throttle\n(300ms). That helps avoid flashing reveals when a stream reveals many\nindividual steps back to back. It can also improve overall performance\nby batching the layout and paint work that has to happen at each step.\n\nUnfortunately we never implemented this for SSR streaming - only for\nclient navigations. This is highly noticeable on very dynamic sites with\nlots of Suspense boundaries. It can look good with a client nav but feel\nglitchy when you reload the page or initial load.\n\nThis fixes the Fizz runtime to be throttled and reveals batched into a\nsingle paint at a time. We do this by first tracking the last paint\nafter the complete (this will be the first paint if `rel=\"expect\"` is\nrespected). Then in the `completeBoundary` operation we queue the\noperation and then flush it all into a throttled batch.\n\nAnother motivation is that View Transitions need to operate as a batch\nand individual steps get queued in a sequence so it's extra important to\ninclude as much content as possible in each animated step. This will be\ndone in a follow up for SSR View Transitions.",

For\nexample, in the following example, instruction 0 is removed while a\nsynthetic `DeclareContext let` is inserted before instruction 1.\n\n```js\n// source\nconst cb = () => x; // reference that causes x to be hoisted\n\nlet x = 4;\nx = 5;\n\n// React Compiler IR\n[0] DeclareContext HoistedLet 'x'\n...\n[1] StoreContext reassign 'x' = 4\n[2] StoreContext reassign 'x' = 5\n```\n\nCurrently, we don't account for `DeclareContext let`. As a result, we're\nrewriting to insert duplicate declarations.\n```js\n// source\nconst cb = () => x; // reference that causes x to be hoisted\n\nlet x;\nx = 5;\n\n// React Compiler IR\n[0] DeclareContext HoistedLet 'x'\n...\n[1] DeclareContext Let 'x'\n[2] StoreContext reassign 'x' = 5\n```\n\n### Solution\n\nInstead of always lowering context variables to a DeclareContext\nfollowed by a StoreContext reassign, we can keep `kind: 'Const' | 'Let'\n| 'Reassign' | etc` on StoreContext.\nPros:\n- retain more information in HIR, so we can codegen easily `const` and\n`let` context variable declarations back\n- pruning hoisted `DeclareContext` instructions is simple.\n\nCons:\n- passes are more verbose as we need to check for both `DeclareContext`\nand `StoreContext` declarations\n\n~(note: also see alternative implementation in\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32745)~\n\n### Testing\nContext variables are tricky. I synced and diffed changes in a large\nmeta codebase and feel pretty confident about landing this. About 0.01%\nof compiled files changed. Among these changes, ~25% were [direct\nbugfixes](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1800029094).\nThe [other\nchanges](https://www.internalfb.com/phabricator/paste/view/P1800028575)\nwere primarily due to changed (corrected) mutable ranges from\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33047.

Starting from the size of the root (minus\npreamble) for the shell.\n\nThis ensures that if you have many small boundaries they don't all\ncontinue to get inlined. For example, you can wrap each paragraph in a\ndocument in a Suspense boundary to regain document streaming\ncapabilities if that's what you want.\n\nHowever, one consideration is if it's worth producing a fallback at all.\nMaybe if it's like `null` it's free but if it's like a whole alternative\npage, then it's not. It's possible to have completely useless Suspense\nboundaries such as when you nest several directly inside each other. So\nthis uses a limit of at least 500 bytes of the content itself for it to\nbe worth outlining at all. It also can't be too small because then for\nexample a long list of paragraphs can never be outlined.\n\nIn the fixture I straddle this limit so some paragraphs are too small to\nbe considered. An unfortunate effect of that is that you can end up with\nsome of them not being outlined which means that they appear out of\norder. SuspenseList is supposed to address that but it's unfortunate.\n\nThe limit is still fairly high though so it's unlikely that by default\nyou'd start outlining anything within the viewport at all.

      "message": "[Fizz] Emit link rel=\"expect\" to block render before the shell has fully loaded (#33016)\n\nThe semantics of React is that anything outside of Suspense boundaries\nin a transition doesn't display until it has fully unsuspended. With SSR\nstreaming the intention is to preserve that.\n\nWe explicitly don't want to support the mode of document streaming\nnormally supported by the browser where it can paint content as tags\nstream in since that leads to content popping in and thrashing in\nunpredictable ways. This should instead be modeled explictly by nested\nSuspense boundaries or something like SuspenseList.\n\nAfter the first shell any nested Suspense boundaries are only revealed,\nby script, once they're fully streamed in to the next boundary. So this\nis already the case there. However, for the initial shell we have been\nat the mercy of browser heuristics for how long it decides to stream\nbefore the first paint.\n\nChromium now has [an API explicitly for this use\ncase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#stabilizing_page_state_to_make_cross-document_transitions_consistent)\nthat lets us model the semantics that we want. This is always important\nbut especially so with MPA View Transitions.\n\nAfter this a simple document looks like this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n     <link rel=\"expect\" href=\"#춺R췉\" blocking=\"render\"/>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>hello world</p>\n    <script src=\"bootstrap.js\" id=\"춺R췉\" async=\"\"></script>\n    ...\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe `rel=\"expect\"` tag indicates that we want to wait to paint until we\nhave streamed far enough to be able to paint the id `\"춺R췉\"` which\nindicates the shell.\n\nIdeally this `id` would be assigned to the root most HTML element in the\nbody. However, this is tricky in our implementation because there can be\nmultiple and we can render them out of order.\n\nSo instead, we assign the id to the first bootstrap script if there is\none since these are always added to the end of the shell. If there isn't\na bootstrap script then we emit an empty `<template\nid=\"춺R췉\"></template>` instead as a marker.\n\nSince we currently put as much as possible in the shell if it's loaded\nby the time we render, this can have some negative effects for very\nlarge documents. We should instead apply the heuristic where very large\nSuspense boundaries get outlined outside the shell even if they're\nimmediately available. This means that even prerenders can end up with\nscript tags.\n\nWe only emit the `rel=\"expect\"` if you're rendering a whole document.\nI.e. if you rendered either a `<html>` or `<head>` tag. If you're\nrendering a partial document, then we don't really know where the\nstreaming parts are anyway and can't provide such guarantees. This does\napply whether you're streaming or not because we still want to block\nrendering until the end, but in practice any serialized state that needs\nhydrate should still be embedded after the completion id.",

Instead, if something suspends while\nhydration, we can just leave the dehydrated content in place. However,\nif something does suspend during client rendering then it should bubble\nup to the parent. Therefore, we have to be careful to only\npushSuspenseHandler when hydrating.

Please\nprovide enough information so that others can review your pull request.\nThe three fields below are mandatory.\n\nBefore submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is\ndone:\n\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create\nyour branch from `main`.\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch\nTestName` is helpful in development.\n5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It\nsupports the same options as `yarn test`.\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`,\nopen `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\n7. Format your code with\n[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only\ncheck changed files.\n  9.

This keeps tooltip\nsummaries concise while allowing for a full breakdown where needed.\n\nThis functionality also respects the `ㄹlways parse hook names from\nsource` setting from the Component inspector, as it uses the same\ncaching mechanism already in place for the Components tab. Additionally,\neven without hook names parsed, the Profiler will now display hook types\n(like `State`, `Callback`, etc.) based on data from `inspectedElement`.\n\nTo enable this across the DevTools, `InspectedElementContext` has been\nmoved higher in the component tree, allowing it to be shared between the\nProfiler and Components tabs. This update allows hook name data to be\nreused across tabs without duplication.\n\nAdditionally, a `getAlreadyLoadedHookNames` helper function was added to\nefficiently access cached hook names, reducing the need for repeated\nfetching when displaying changes.\n\nThese changes improve the ability to track specific hook updates within\nthe Profiler tab, making it clearer to see what뗩 changed.\n\n### Before\nPreviously, the Profiler tab displayed only the IDs of changed hooks, as\nshown below:\n<img width=\"350\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-01 at 12 02 21_cropped\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a5f5f67-f1c8-4261-9ba3-1c76c9a88af3\">\n\n### After (without hook names parsed)\nWhen hook names aren뗪 parsed, custom hooks and hook types are displayed\nbased on the inspectedElement data:\n<img width=\"350\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-01 at 12 03 09_cropped\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed857a6d-e6ef-4e5b-982c-bf30c2d8a7e2\">\n\n### After (with hook names parsed)\nOnce hook names are fully parsed, the Profiler tab provides a complete\nbreakdown of specific hooks that have changed:\n<img width=\"350\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-01 at 12 03 14_cropped\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ddfcc35-7474-4f4d-a084-f4e9f993a5bf\">\n\nThis should resolve #21856 游꿀",

This is revisiting a variant of what\nwas discussed in #11163.\n\nInstead of supporting the [`srcObject`\nproperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/srcObject)\nas a separate name, this adds an overload of `src` to allow objects to\nbe passed. The DOM needs to add separate properties for the object forms\nsince you read back but it doesn't make sense for React's write-only API\nto do that. Similar to how we'll like add an overload for\n`popoverTarget` instead of calling it `popoverTargetElement` and how\n`style` accepts an object and it's not `styleObject={{...}}`.\n\nThere are a number of reason to revisit this.\n\n- It's just way more convenient to have this built-in and it makes\nconceptual sense. We typically support declarative APIs and polyfill\nthem when necessary.\n- RSC supports Blobs and by having it built-in you don't need a Client\nComponent wrapper to render it where as doing it with effects would\nrequire more complex wrappers. By picking Blobs over base64,\nclient-navigations can use the more optimized binary encoding in the RSC\nprotocol.\n- The timing aspect of coordinating it with Suspensey images and image\ndecoding is a bit tricky to get right because if you set it in an effect\nit's too late because you've already rendered it.\n- SSR gets complicated when done in user space because you have to\nhandle both branches. Likely with `useSyncExternalStore`.\n- By having it built-in we could optimize the payloads shared between\nRSC payloads embedded in the HTML and data URLs.\n\nThis does not support objects for `<source src>` nor `<img srcset>`.\nThose don't really have equivalents in the DOM neither. They're mainly\nfor picking an option when you don't know programmatically. However, for\nthis use case you're really better off picking a variant before\ngenerating the blobs.\n\nWe may support Response objects in the future too as per\nhttps://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/49",

The previous hack just consumed all transition types when any\nroot committed so it could steal them from other roots. Really each root\nshould get its own set. Really each transition lane should get its own\nset.\n\nWe can't implement the full ideal semantics yet because 1) we currently\nentangle transition lanes 2) we lack `AsyncContext` on the client so for\nasync actions we can't associate a `addTransitionType` call to a\nspecific `startTransition`.\n\nThis starts by modeling Transition Types to be stored on the Transition\ninstance. Conceptually they belong to the Transition instance of that\n`startTransition` they belong to. That instance is otherwise mostly just\nused for Transition Tracing but it makes sense that those would be able\nto be passed the Transition Types for that specific instance.\n\nNested `startTransition` need to get entangled. So that this\n`addTransitionType` can be associated with the `setState`:\n\n```js\nstartTransition(() => {\n  startTransition(() => {\n    addTransitionType(...)\n  });\n  setState(...);\n});\n```\n\nIdeally we'd probably just use the same Transition instance itself since\nthese are conceptually all part of one entangled one. But transition\ntracing uses multiple names and start times. Unclear what we want to do\nwith that. So I kept separate instances but shared `types` set.\n\nNext I collect the types added during a `startTransition` to any root\nscheduled with a Transition. This should really be collected one set per\nTransition lane in a `LaneMap`. In fact, the information would already\nbe there if Transition Tracing was always enabled because it tracks all\nTransition instances per lane. For now I just keep track of one set for\nall Transition lanes. Maybe we should only add it if a `setState` was\ndone on this root in this particular `startTransition` call rather\nhaving already scheduled any Transition earlier.\n\nWhile async transitions are entangled, we don't know if there will be a\nstartTransition+setState on a new root in the future. Therefore, we\ncollect all transition types while this is happening and if a new root\ngets startTransition+setState they get added to that root.\n\n```js\nstartTransition(async () => {\n  addTransitionType(...)\n  await ...;\n  setState(...);\n});\n```",

This will replace [the `useSwipeTransition`\nAPI](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32373).\n\nInstead, of a special Hook, you can make updates to `useOptimistic`\nHooks within the `startGestureTransition` scope.\n\n```\nimport {unstable_startGestureTransition as startGestureTransition} from 'react';\n\nconst cancel = startGestureTransition(timeline, () => {\n  setOptimistic(...);\n}, options);\n```\n\nThere are some downsides to this like you can't define two directions as\nonce and there's no \"standard\" direction protocol. It's instead up to\nlibraries to come up with their own conventions (although we can suggest\nsome).\n\nThe convention is still that a gesture recognizer has two props `action`\nand `gesture`. The `gesture` prop is a Gesture concept which now behaves\nmore like an Action but 1) it can't be async 2) it shouldn't have\nside-effects. For example you can't call `setState()` in it except on\n`useOptimistic` since those can be reverted if needed. The `action` is\ninvoked with whatever side-effects you want after the gesture fulfills.\n\nThis is isomorphic and not associated with a specific renderer nor root\nso it's a bit more complicated.\n\nTo implement this I unify with the `ReactSharedInternal.T` property to\ncontain a regular Transition or a Gesture Transition (the `gesture`\nfield). The benefit of this unification means that every time we\noverride this based on some scope like entering `flushSync` we also\noverride the `startGestureTransition` scope. We just have to be careful\nwhen we read it to check the `gesture` field to know which one it is.\n(E.g. I error for setState / requestFormReset.)\n\nThe other thing that's unique is the `cancel` return value to know when\nto stop the gesture. That cancellation is no longer associated with any\nparticular Hook. It's more associated with the scope of the\n`startGestureTransition`. Since the schedule of whether a particular\ngesture has rendered or committed is associated with a root, we need to\nsomehow associate any scheduled gestures with a root.\n\nWe could track which roots we update inside the scope but instead, I\nwent with a model where I check all the roots and see if there's a\nscheduled gesture matching the timeline. This means that you could\n\"retain\" a gesture across roots. Meaning this wouldn't cancel until both\nare cancelled:\n\n```\nconst cancelA = startGestureTransition(timeline, () => {\n  setOptimisticOnRootA(...);\n}, options);\n\nconst cancelB = startGestureTransition(timeline, () => {\n  setOptimisticOnRootB(...);\n}, options);\n```\n\nIt's more like it's a global transition than associated with the roots\nthat were updated.\n\nOptimistic updates mostly just work but I now associate them with a\nspecific \"ScheduledGesture\" instance since we can only render one at a\ntime and so if it's not the current one, we leave it for later.\n\nClean up of optimistic updates is now lazy rather than when we cancel.\nAllowing the cancel closure not to have to be associated with each\nparticular update.",

      "message": "Mark the root as animating if any Portal mutates or resizes (#32772)\n\nPortals and `<ViewTransition>` are tricky because they leave the React\ntree. You might think of a Portal's container conceptually as also being\npart of a React tree but that's not quite how they're modeled today.\nThey're more like their own roots. So instead, of trying to find a\nconceptual place in the React tree we treat Portals as their own root.\n\nWe have two ways of tracking whether an update to a ViewTransition\nboundary has occurred. Either a DOM mutation has happened within it, or\na resize of a child has caused it to potentially relayout its parent.\nNormally that just follows the tree structure of React, but not when\nit's a Portal.\n\nWhen it's a Portal we don't know which DOM parent it might have\naffected. For all we know it's at the root (and in fact, in most cases\nthat's where Portals go).\n\nWith this PR we mark the root as having been affected by a mutation or\nresize. This means that the whole document will animate and we can't\noptimize away from it. This ensures that a mutation to the root of a\nPortal doesn't go unanimated with other things are animating such as its\nparent.\n\nYou can regain this optimization by adding a `<ViewTransition>` boundary\ndirectly inside the Portal itself so it owns its own animation. If that\nDOM node is also absolutely positioned it doesn't leak.\n\nConversely this also means that a mutation inside a Portal doesn't\naffect its React parent so it won't trigger its parent's animation if\nthis was the only thing animating. That could be unfortunate if this\ncontainer is actually inside the same React parent. However, because\nthis would have been an update we would've marked it for \"maybe\nanimating\" and updates can't only get their animations cancelled if the\nroot is cancelled, in practice this will actually animate anyway.",

      "message": "Rename <ViewTransition className=\"...\"> to <ViewTransition default=\"...\"> (#32734)\n\nIt was always confusing that this is not a CSS class but a\nview-transition-class.\n\nThe `className` sticks out a bit among its siblings `enter`, `exit`,\n`update` and `share`. The idea is that the most specific definition\noverride is the class name that gets applied and this prop is really\njust the fallback, catch-all or \"any\" that is applied if you didn't\nspecify a more specific one.\n\nIt has also since evolved not just to take a string but also a map of\nTransition Type to strings.\n\nThe \"class\" is really the type of the value. We could add a suffix to\nall of them like `defaultClass`, `enterClass`, `exitClass`,\n`updateClass` and `shareClass`. However, this doesn't necessarily make\nsense with the mapping of Transition Type to string. It also makes it a\nbit too DOM centric. In React Native this might still be called a\n\"class\" but it might be represented by an object definition. We might\neven allow some kind of inline style form for the DOM too. Really this\nis about picking which \"animation\" that runs which can be a string or\ninstance. \"Animation\" is too broad because there's also a concept of a\nCSS Animation and these are really sets of CSS animations (group,\nimage-pair, old, new). It could maybe be `defaultTransition`,\n`enterTransition`, etc but that seems unnecessarily repetitive and still\ndoesn't say anything about it being a class.\n\nWe also already have the name \"default\" in the map of Transition Types.\nIn fact you can now specify a default for default:\n\n```\n<ViewTransition default={{\"navigation-back\": \"slide-out\", \"default\": \"fade-in\"}}>\n```\n\nOne thing I don't like about the name `\"default\"` is that it might be\ncommon to just apply a named class that does it matching to\nenter/exit/update in the CSS selectors (such as the `:only-child` rule)\ninstead of doing that mapping to each one using React. In that can you\nend up specifying only `default={...}` a lot and then what is it the\n\"default\" for? It's more like \"all\". I think it's likely that you end up\nwith either \"default\" or the specific forms instead of both at once.",

      "message": "Don't flush synchronous work if we're in the middle of a ViewTransition async sequence (#32760)\n\nStarting a View Transition is an async sequence. Since React can get a\nsync update in the middle of sequence we sometimes interrupt that\nsequence.\n\nCurrently, we don't actually cancel the View Transition so it can just\nrun as a partial. This ensures that we fully skip it when that happens,\nas well as warn.\n\nHowever, it's very easy to trigger this with just a setState in\nuseLayoutEffect right now. Therefore if we're inside the preparing\nsequence of a startViewTransition, this delays work that would've\nnormally flushed in a microtask. ~Maybe we want to do the same for\nDefault work already scheduled through a scheduler Task.~ Edit: This was\nalready done.\n\n`flushSync` currently will still lead to an interrupted View Transition\n(with a warning). There's a tradeoff here whether we want to try our\nbest to preserve the guarantees of `flushSync` or favor the animation.\nIt's already possible to suspend at the root with `flushSync` which\nmeans it's not always 100% guaranteed to commit anyway.

Please\nprovide enough information so that others can review your pull request.\nThe three fields below are mandatory.\n\nBefore submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is\ndone:\n\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create\nyour branch from `main`.\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch\nTestName` is helpful in development.\n5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It\nsupports the same options as `yarn test`.\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`,\nopen `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\n7. Format your code with\n[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only\ncheck changed files.\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\n\nLearn more about contributing:\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\n-->\n\n## Summary\n1. Having a development build for FB will be convenient for fb internal\nfeature development\n2. Add a new checkbox to toggle new internal features added to React\nDevtools.\n\n## How did you test this change?\n1. yarn test\n2. set extra env variables in bash profile and build an internal version\nwith the new script.\n3. toggle on/off the new checkbox, the value is stored in local storage\ncorrectly.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Aohua Mu <muaohua@fb.com>",

We specifically look for the results of call expressions, new expressions, or function expressions that are then used directly (or aliased) as a JSX tag. This allows common sketchy but fine-in-practice cases like passing a reference to a component from a parent as props, but catches very obvious mistakes such as:\n\n```js\nfunction Example() {\n  const Component = createComponent();\n  return <Component />;\n}\n```\n\nWe could expand this to catch more cases, but this seems like a reasonable starting point. Note that I tried enabling the validation by default and the only fixtures that error are the new ones added here. I'll also test this internally. What i'm imagining is that we enable this in the linter but not the compiler.\n\nghstack-source-id: e7408c0a55478b40d65489703d209e8fa7205e45\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32683",

      "message": "Minor Fixes to View Transition Fixture (#32664)\n\nFollow up to #32656.\n\nRemove touchAction from SwipeRecognizer. I was under the wrong\nimpression that this was only the touch-action applied to this\nparticular element, but that parents would still win but in fact this\nblocks the parent from scrolling in the other direction. By specifying a\nfixed direction it also blocked rage-swiping in the other direction\nearly on.\n\nDisable pointer-events on view-transition so that the scroll can be hit.\nThis means that touches hit below the items animating above. This allows\nswiping to happen again before momentum scroll has finished. Previously\nthey were ignored. This only works as long as the SwipeRecognizer is\nitself not animating. This means you can now rage-swipe in both\ndirections quickly.",

We assume that a function \"is\nlikely called\" if we observe the following in the react function body.\n\n- a direct callsite\n- passed directly as a jsx attribute or child\n- passed directly to a hook\n- a direct return\n\nA function is also \"likely called\" if it is directly called, passed to\njsx / hooks, or returned from another function that \"is likely called\".\n\nNote that this approach marks the function definition site with its\nhoistable properties (not its use site). I tried implementing use-site\nhoisting semantics, but it felt both unpredictable (i.e. as a developer,\nI can't trust that callbacks are well memoized) and not helpful (type +\nnull checks of a value are usually colocated with their use site)\n\nIn this fixture (copied here for easy reference), it should be safe to\nuse `a.value` and `b.value` as dependencies, even though these functions\nare conditionally called.\n```js\n// inner-function/nullable-objects/assume-invoked/conditional-call-chain.tsx\nfunction Component({a, b}) {\n  const logA = () => {\n    console.log(a.value);\n  };\n  const logB = () => {\n    console.log(b.value);\n  };\n  const hasLogged = useRef(false);\n  const log = () => {\n    if (!hasLogged.current) {\n      logA();\n      logB();\n      hasLogged.current = true;\n    }\n  };\n  return <Stringify log={log} shouldInvokeFns={true} />;\n}\n```\n\nOn the other hand, this means that we produce invalid output for code\nlike manually implementing `Array.map`\n```js\n// inner-function/nullable-objects/bug-invalid-array-map-manual.js\nfunction useFoo({arr1, arr2}) {\n  const cb = e => arr2[0].value + e.value;\n  const y = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {\n    y.push(cb(arr1[i]));\n  }\n  return y;\n}\n```",

      "message": "Add observer methods to fragment instances (#32619)\n\nThis implements `observeUsing(observer)` and `unobserverUsing(observer)`\non fragment instances. IntersectionObservers and ResizeObservers can be\npassed to observe each host child of the fragment. This is the\nequivalent to calling `observer.observe(child)` or\n`observer.unobserve(child)` for each child target.\n\nJust like the addEventListener, the observer is held on the fragment\ninstance and applied to any newly mounted child. So you can do things\nlike wrap a paginated list in a fragment and have each child\nautomatically observed as they commit in.\n\nUnlike, the event listeners though, we don't `unobserve` when a child is\nremoved. If a removed child is currently intersecting, the observer\ncallback will be called when it is removed with an empty rect. This lets\nyou track all the currently intersecting elements by setting state from\nthe observer callback and either adding or removing them from your list\ndepending on the intersecting state. If you want to track the removal of\nitems offscreen, you'd have to maintain that state separately and append\nintersecting data to it in the observer callback. This is what the\nfixture example does.\n\nThere could be more convenient ways of managing the state of multiple\nchild intersections, but basic examples are able to be modeled with the\nsimple implementation. Let's see how the usage goes as we integrate this\nwith more advanced loggers and other features.\n\nFor now you can only attach one observer to an instance. This could\nchange based on usage but the fragments are composable and could be\nstacked as one way to apply multiple observers to the same elements.\n\nIn practice, one pattern we expect to enable is more composable logging\nsuch as\n\n```javascript\nfunction Feed({ items }) {\n  return (\n    <ImpressionLogger>\n      {items.map((item) => (\n        <FeedItem />\n      ))}\n    </ImpressionLogger>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nwhere `ImpressionLogger` would set up the IntersectionObserver using a\nfragment ref with the required business logic and various components\ncould layer it wherever the logging is needed. Currently most callsites\nuse a hook form, which can require wiring up refs through the tree and\nmerging refs for multiple loggers.",

I'll do that in a separate PR to keep reviewing easier.\n\nThe three phases of this approach is roughly:\n\n- Clone and apply names to the \"old\" state.\n- Inside startViewTransition: Apply names to the \"new\" state. Measure\nboth the \"old\" and \"new\" state to know whether to cancel some of them.\nDelete the clones which will include all the \"old\" names.\n- After startViewTransition: Restore \"new\" names back to no\nview-transition-name.\n\nSince we don't have any other Effects in these phases we have a bit more\nflexibility and we can avoid extra phases that traverse the tree. I've\ntried to avoid any additional passes.\n\nAn interesting consequence of this approach is that we could measure\nboth the \"old\" and \"new\" state before `startViewTransition`. This would\nbe more efficient because we wouldn't need to take View Transition\nsnapshots of parts of the tree that won't actually animate. However,\nthat would require an extra pass and force layout earlier. It would also\nhave different semantics from the fire-and-forget View Transitions\nbecause we could optimize better which can be visible. It would also not\naccount for any late mutations. So I decided to instead let the layout\nbe computed by painting as usual and then measure both \"old\" and \"new\"\ninside the startViewTransition instead. Then canceling anything that\ndoesn't animate to keep it consistent.\n\nUnfortunately, though there's not a lot of code sharing possible in\nthese phases because the strategy is so different with the cloning and\nbecause the animation is performed in reverse. The \"finishedWork\" Fiber\nrepresents the \"old\" state and the \"current\" Fiber represents the \"new\"\nstate.\n\nThe most complicated phase is the cloning. I actually ended up having to\nmake a very different pattern from the other phases and CommitWork in\ngeneral. Because we have to clone as we go and also do other things like\napply names and finding pairs, it has more phases. I ended up with an\napproach that uses three different loops. The outer one for updated\ntrees, one for inserted trees that don't need cloning (doesn't include\nreappearing offscreen) and one for not updated trees that still need\ncloning. Inside each loop it can also be in different phases which I\ntrack with the `visitPhase` enum - this pattern is kind of new.\n\nAdditionally, we need to measure the cloned nodes after we've applied\nmutations to them and we have to wait until the whole tree is inserted.\nWe don't have a reference to these DOM elements in the Fiber tree since\nthat still refers to the original ones. We need to store the cloned\nelements somewhere. So I added a temporary field on the\nViewTransitionState to keep track of any clones owned by that\nViewTransition.\n\nWhen we deep clone an unchanged subtree we don't have DOM element\ninstances. It wouldn't be quite safe to try to find them from the tree\nstructure. So we need to avoid the deep clones if we might need DOM\nelements. Therefore we keep traversing in the case where we need to find\nnested ViewTransition boundaries that are either potentially affected by\nlayout or a \"pair\".\n\nFor the other two phases the pattern there's a lot of code duplication\nsince it's slightly different from the commit ones but they at least\nfollow the same pattern. For the restore phase I was actually able to\nreuse most of the code.\n\nI don't love how much code this is.",

      "message": "[compiler] Avoid bailouts when inserting gating (#32598)\n\nThis change fixes a coverage hole in rolling out with `gating`. Prior to\nthis PR, configuring `gating` causes React Compiler to bail out of\noptimizing some functions.\n\nThis means that it's not entirely safe to cutover from `gating` enabled\nfor all users (i.e. rolled out 100%) to removing the `gating` config\naltogether, as new functions may be opted into compilation when they\nstop bailing out due to gating-specific logic.\n\nThis is technically slightly slower due to the additional function\nindirection. An alternative approach is to recommend running a codemod\nto insert `use no memo`s on currently-bailing out functions before\nremoving the`gating` config.\n\n---\nTested [internally](\nhttps://fburl.com/diff/q982ovua) by enabling on a page that previously\nhad a few hundred bailouts due to gating + hoisted function declarations\nand (1) clicking around locally and (2) running a bunch of e2e tests",

      "message": "fix: clarify which mobx libs are not compatible with compiler (#32570)\n\n## Summary\n\nRight now, `react-compiler-healthcheck` flags `mobx` as a \"known\nincompatible library\". But it's not precisely *MobX* that's\nincompatible. It's the observer HOC that comes from `mobx-react` and\n`mobx-react-lite`.\n\nI've been working on\n[mst-use-observable](https://github.com/coolsoftwaretyler/mst-use-observable),\nwhich makes MobX-State-Tree compatible with the compiler. However,\nprojects that use `mobx-state-tree` and `mst-use-observable` will still\ndepend on `mobx` as a dependency.\n\nAnd there [have been efforts in the past to write a hook for\nobservability](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/discussions/2566). So it's\npossible that MobX could become compatible, so long as authors access it\nwith a hook, rather than the HOC.\n\nI would like to propose updating the health check to be a little more\nprecise and flag the HOC dependencies, rather than MobX itself.\n\nThanks in advance for your consideration!\n\n## How did you test this change?\n\n`npx react-compiler-healthcheck` shouldn't flag on `mobx` in\ndependencies, but will for `mobx-react-lite` and `mobx-react`.\n\nTest suites, formatting, linting, all passed.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: lauren <poteto@users.noreply.github.com>",

      "message": "feat(eslint-plugin-react-hooks): merge rule from eslint-plugin-react-compiler into `react-hooks` plugin (#32416)\n\nThis change merges the `react-compiler` rule from\n`eslint-plugin-react-compiler` into the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`\nplugin. In order to do the move in a way that keeps commit history with\nthe moved files, but also no remove them from their origin until a\nfuture cleanup change can be done, I did the `git mv` first, and then\nrecreated the files that were moved in their original places, as a\nseparate commit. Unfortunately GH shows the moved files as new instead\nof the ones that are truly new. But in the IDE and `git blame`, commit\nhistory is intact with the moved files.\n\nSince this change adds new dependencies, and one of those dependencies\nhas a higher `engines` declaration for `node` than what the plugin\ncurrently has, this is technically a breaking change and will have to go\nout as part of a major release.\n\n### Related Changes\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32458\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Lauren Tan <poteto@users.noreply.github.com>",

The difference here is that we traverse from the Fragment's fiber at\noperation time instead of keeping a set of children on the\n`FragmentInstance`. We still need to handle newly added or removed child\nnodes to apply event listeners and observers, so we treat those updates\nas effects.\n\n**Fragment Refs**\n\nThis PR extends React's Fragment component to accept a `ref` prop. The\nFragment's ref will attach to a custom host instance, which will provide\nan Element-like API for working with the Fragment's host parent and host\nchildren.\n\nHere I've implemented `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, and\n`focus` to get started but we'll be iterating on this by adding\nadditional APIs in future PRs. This sets up the mechanism to attach refs\nand perform operations on children. The FragmentInstance is implemented\nin `react-dom` here but is planned for Fabric as well.\n\nThe API works by targeting the first level of host children and proxying\nElement-like APIs to allow developers to manage groups of elements or\nelements that cannot be easily accessed such as from a third-party\nlibrary or deep in a tree of Functional Component wrappers.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Fragment, useRef} from 'react';\n\nconst fragmentRef = useRef(null);\n\n<Fragment ref={fragmentRef}>\n  <div id=\"A\" />\n  <Wrapper>\n    <div id=\"B\">\n      <div id=\"C\" />\n    </div>\n  </Wrapper>\n  <div id=\"D\" />\n</Fragment>\n```\n\nIn this case, calling `fragmentRef.current.addEventListener()` would\napply an event listener to `A`, `B`, and `D`. `C` is skipped because it\nis nested under the first level of Host Component. If another Host\nComponent was appended as a sibling to `A`, `B`, or `D`, the event\nlistener would be applied to that element as well and any other APIs\nwould also affect the newly added child.\n\nThis is an implementation of the basic feature as a starting point for\nfeedback and further iteration.",

      "message": "[compiler] Migrate compiler packages to tsup (#32550)\n\nCurrently in the `compiler` workspace, we invoke esbuild directly to\nbuild most packages (with the exception of `snap`). This has been mostly\nfine, but does not allow us to do things like generate type declaration\nfiles.\n\nI would like #32416 to be able to consume the merged\neslint-plugin-react-compiler from source rather than via npm, and one of\nthe things that has come up from my exploration in that stack using the\ncompiler from source is that babel-plugin-react-compiler is missing type\ndeclarations. This is primarily because React's build process uses\nrollup + rollup-plugin-typescript, which runs tsc. So the merged plugin\nneeds to typecheck properly in order to build. An alternative might be\nto migrate to something like babel with rollup instead to simply strip\ntypes rather than typecheck before building. The minor downside of that\napproach is that we would need to manually maintain a d.ts file for\neslint-plugin-react-hooks. For now I would like to see if this PR helps\nus make progress rather than go for the slightly worse alternative.\n\n[`tsup`](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) is esbuild based so build\nperformance is comparable. It is slower when generating d.ts files, but\nit's still much faster than rollup which we used prior to esbuild. For\nnow, I have turned off `dts` by default, and it is only passed when\npublishing on npm.\n\nIf you want to also generate d.ts files you can run `yarn build --dts`.\n\n```\n# BEFORE: build all compiler packages (esbuild)\n$ time yarn build\n\n九  Done in 15.61s.\nyarn build  13.82s user 1.54s system 96% cpu 15.842 total\n\n# ---\n\n# AFTER: build all compiler packages (tsup)\n$ time yarn build\n\n九  Done in 12.39s.\nyarn build  12.58s user 1.68s system 106% cpu 13.350 total\n\n# ---\n\n# AFTER: build all compiler packages and type declarations (tsup)\n$ time yarn build --dts\n\n九  Done in 30.69s.\nyarn build  43.57s user 3.20s system 150% cpu 31.061 total\n```\n\nI still need to test if this unblocks #32416 but this stack can be\nlanded independently though as we could probably just release type\ndeclarations on npm. No one should be using the compiler directly, but\nif they really wanted to, lack of type declarations would not stop them\n(cf React secret internals).\n\nNote that I still kept esbuild as we still use it directly for forgive.\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

What existing problem\ndoes the pull request solve?\n-->\n\nThis PR fixes asserts when `passChildrenWhenCloningPersistedNodes` is\nenabled for React Native and OffscreenComponent child rendering unhides\nhost components.\n\nDiscussions around possible fixes for the asserts seen in React Native\nsuggested changing the way we handle hiding/unhiding host components by\nupdating the fiber state with the hidden host component instead of\nsubmitting a hidden clone Fabric and keeping the original as the current\nfiber.\n\nImplementing this fix would require holding onto the original styling of\nthe hidden host component. The reconciler updates the styling by adding\n`display: none` to hide the contents. If the original host component was\nalready hidden, the renderer would lose that information and remove the\nstyling when showing the contents again.\n\nTo reduce the changes required to make\n`passChildrenWhenCloningPersistedNodes` work, this PR falls back to the\noriginal cloning method when OffscreenComponents are part of the\nchildren needed to be added back. This effectively resolve the asserts\ntriggered by the feature in RN and improves overall performance.\n\n## How did you test this change?\n\n<!--\nDemonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and\ntheir output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user\ninterface.\nHow exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to\nsolve?\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\n-->\n\nThis fix was tested by enabling `passChildrenWhenCloningPersistedNodes`\nin an app built with React Native that had a repro for triggering the\nasserts. The asserts do not occur anymore when using the changes in this\nPR.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Nick <lefever@meta.com>",

This\nwas already the case when `serverModuleMap` wasn't passed. This is how\nyou can pass server references back to the server. However, when we\nadded `serverModuleMap` that pass was skipped because we were getting\nreal functions instead of proxies.\n\nFor functions that wasn't yet passed from the remote server to the\ncurrent server, we can register them eagerly just like we do for\n`import('/server').registerServerReference()`. You can now also do this\nwith `import('/client').registerServerReference()`. We could make them\nshared so you only have to do this once but it might not be possible to\npass to the remote server and the remote server might not even be the\nsame RSC renderer. Therefore I split them. It's up to the compiler\nwhether it should do that or not. It has to know that any function you\nmight call might be able to receive it.

      "message": "During a Swipe Gesture Render a Clone Offscreen and Animate it Onscreen (#32500)\n\nThis is really the essence mechanism of the `useSwipeTransition`\nfeature.\n\nWe don't want to immediately switch to the destination state when\nstarting a gesture. The effects remain mounted on the current state. We\nwant the current state to be \"live\". This is important to for example\nallow a video to keeping playing while starting a swipe (think\nTikTok/Reels) and not stop until you've committed the action. The only\nthing that can be live is the \"new\" state. Therefore we treat the\ndestination as the \"old\" state and perform a reverse animation from\nthere.\n\nIdeally we could apply the old state to the DOM tree, take a snapshot\nand then revert it back in the mutation of `startViewTransition`.\nUnfortunately, the way `startViewTransition` was designed it always\npaints one frame of the \"old\" state which would lead this to cause a\nflicker.\n\nTo work around this, we need to create a clone of any View Transition\nboundary that might be mutated and then render that offscreen. That way\nwe can render the \"current\" state on screen and the \"destination\" state\noffscreen for the screenshots. Being mutated can be either due to React\ndoing a DOM mutation or if a child boundary resizes that causes the\nparent to relayout. We don't have to do this for insertions or deletions\nsince they only appear on one side.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that we have to clone the whole root. That's\nwhat this first PR implements. We clone the container and if it's not\nabsolutely positioned, we position it on top of the current one. If the\ncontainer is `document` or `<html>` we instead clone the `<body>` tag\nsince it's the only one we can insert a duplicate of. If the container\nis deep in the tree we clone just that even though technically we should\nprobably clone the whole document in that case. We just keep the impact\nsmaller. Ideally though we'd never hit this case. In fact, if we clone\nthe document we issue a warning (always for now) since you probably\nshould optimize this. In the future I intend to add optimizations when\naffected View Transition boundaries are absolutely positioned since they\ncannot possibly relayout the parent. This would be the ideal way to use\nthis feature most efficiently but it still works without it.\n\nSince we render the \"old\" state outside the viewport, we need to then\nadjust the animation to put it back into the viewport. This is the\ntrickiest part to get right while still preserving any customization of\nthe View Transitions done using CSS. This current approach reapplies all\nthe animations with adjusted keyframes.\n\nIn the case of an \"exit\" the pseudo-element itself is positioned outside\nthe viewport but since we can't programmatically update the style of the\npseudo-element itself we instead adjust all the keyframes to put it back\ninto the viewport. If there is no animation on the group we add one.\n\nIn the case of an \"update\" the pseudo-element is positioned on the new\nstate which is already inside the viewport. However, the auto-generated\nanimation of the group has a starting keyframe that starts outside the\nviewport. In this case we need to adjust that keyframe.\n\nIn the future I might explore a technique that inserts stylesheets\ninstead of mutating the animations. It might be simpler. But whatever\nhacks work to maximize the compatibility is best.",

Safari still doesn't support `scrollend` and there's no\nindication that they will anytime soon so this polyfills it.\n\nWhile I don't particularly love our synthetic event system this tries to\nstay within the realm of how our other polyfills work. This implements\nall `onScrollEnd` events as a plugin.\n\nThe basic principle is to first feature detect the `onscrollend` DOM\nproperty to see if there's native support and otherwise just use the\nnative event.\n\nThen we listen to `scroll` events and set a timeout. If we don't get any\nmore scroll events before the timeout we fire `onScrollEnd`. Basically\ndebouncing it. If we're currently pressing down on touch or a mouse then\nwe wait until it is lifted such as if you're scrolling with a finger or\nusing the scrollbars on desktop but isn't currently moving.\n\nIf we do get any native events even though we're in polyfilling mode, we\nuse that as an indication to fire the `onScrollEnd` early.\n\nPart of the motivation is that this becomes extra useful pair for\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32422. We also probably need\nthese events to coincide with other gesture related internals so you're\nbetter off using our polyfill so they're synced.",

      "message": "Add Commit Scaffolding for Gestures (#32451)\n\nThis adds a `ReactFiberApplyGesture` which is basically intended to be a\nfork of the phases in `ReactFiberCommitWork` except for the fake commit\nthat `useSwipeTransition` does. So far none of the phases are actually\nimplemented yet. This is just the scaffolding around them so I can fill\nthem in later.\n\nThe important bit is that we call `startViewTransition` (via the\n`startGestureTransition` Config) when a gesture starts. We add a paused\nanimation to prevent the transition from committing (even if the\nScrollTimeline goes to 100%). This also locks the documents so that we\ncan't commit any other Transitions until it completes.\n\nWhen the gesture completes (scroll end) then we stop the gesture View\nTransition. If there's no new work scheduled we do that immediately but\nif there was any new work already scheduled, then we assume that this\nwill potentially commit the new state. So we wait for that to finish.\nThis lets us lock the animation in its state instead of snapping back\nand then applying the real update.\n\nUsing this technique we can't actually run a View Transition from the\ncurrent state to the actual committed state because it would snap back\nto the beginning and then run the View Transition from there. Therefore\nany new commit needs to skip View Transitions even if it should've\ntechnically animated to that state. We assume that the new state is the\nsame as the optimistic state you already swiped to. An alternative to\nthis technique could be to commit the optimistic state when we cancel\nand then apply any new updates o top of that. I might explore that in\nthe future.\n\nRegardless it's important that the `action` associated with the swipe\nschedules some work before we cancel. Otherwise it risks reverting\nfirst. So I had to update this in the fixture.",

Instead of\nhaving this built-in to React itself, instead the idea is to leave this\nto various user space Component libraries. It can be done in different\nways for different use cases. It could use JS driven or native\nScrollTimeline or both.\n\nThis example uses a native scroll with scroll snapping to two edges. If\nyou swipe far enough to snap to the other edge, it triggers an Action at\nthe end.\n\nThis particular example uses a `position: sticky` to wrap the content of\nthe Gesture Recognizer. This means that it's inert by itself. It doesn't\nscroll its content just like a plain JS recognizer using pointer events\nwould. This is useful because it means that scrolling doesn't affect\ncontent before we start (the \"scroll\" event fires after scrolling has\nalready started) so we don't have to both trying to start it earlier. It\nalso means that scrolling doesn't affect the live content which can lead\nto unexpected effects on the View Transition.\n\nI find the inert recognizer the most useful pairing with\n`useSwipeTransition` but it's not the only way to do it. E.g. you can\nalso have a scrollable surface that uses plain scrolling with snapping\nand then just progressively enhances swiping between steps.",

This means that they were\r\nsubject to some deopts (most notably, not being easily dedupable /\r\nhoistable as dependencies).\r\n\r\nNow, `PropertyLoad`, `PropertyStore`, etc reference numeric and string\r\nliterals (although not yet string literals that aren't valid babel\r\nidentifiers). The difference between PropertyLoad and ComputedLoad is\r\nfuzzy now (maybe we should rename these).\r\n- PropertyLoad: property keys are string and numeric literals, only when\r\nthe string literals are valid babel identifiers\r\n- ComputedLoad: non-valid babel identifier string literals (rare) and\r\nother non-literal expressions\r\n\r\nThe biggest feature from this PR is that it trivially enables\r\narray-indicing expressions as dependencies. The compiler can also\r\nspecify global and imported types for arrays (e.g. return value of\r\n`useState`)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm happy to close this if it complicates more than it helps --\r\nalternative options are to entirely rely on instruction reordering-based\r\napproaches like ReactiveGraphIR or make dependency-specific parsing +\r\nhoisting logic more robust.",

      "message": "Add useSwipeTransition Hook Behind Experimental Flag (#32373)\n\nThis Hook will be used to drive a View Transition based on a gesture.\n\n```js\nconst [value, startGesture] = useSwipeTransition(prev, current, next);\n```\n\nThe `enableSwipeTransition` flag will depend on `enableViewTransition`\nflag but we may decide to ship them independently. This PR doesn't do\nanything interesting yet. There will be a lot more PRs to build out the\nactual functionality. This is just wiring up the plumbing for the new\nHook.\n\nThis first PR is mainly concerned with how the whole starts (and stops).\nThe core API is the `startGesture` function (although there will be\nother conveniences added in the future). You can call this to start a\ngesture with a source provider. You can call this multiple times in one\nevent to batch multiple Hooks listening to the same provider. However,\neach render can only handle one source provider at a time and so it does\none render per scheduled gesture provider.\n\nThis uses a separate `GestureLane` to drive gesture renders by marking\nthe Hook as having an update on that lane. Then schedule a render. These\nrenders should be blocking and in the same microtask as the\n`startGesture` to ensure it can block the paint. So it's similar to\nsync.\n\nIt may not be possible to finish it synchronously e.g. if something\nsuspends. If so, it just tries again later when it can like any other\nrender. This can also happen because it also may not be possible to\ndrive more than one gesture at a time like if we're limited to one View\nTransition per document. So right now you can only run one gesture at a\ntime in practice.\n\nThese renders never commit. This means that we can't clear the\n`GestureLane` the normal way. Instead, we have to clear only the root's\n`pendingLanes` if we don't have any new renders scheduled. Then wait\nuntil something else updates the Fiber after all gestures on it have\nstopped before it really clears.",

Please\r\nprovide enough information so that others can review your pull request.\r\nThe three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is\r\ndone:\r\n\r\n1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create\r\nyour branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch\r\nTestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It\r\nsupports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`,\r\nopen `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with\r\n[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only\r\ncheck changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

Public instances are generally only necessary when\r\naccessed via refs or events, and that usually happens for a small amount\r\nof components in the tree.\r\n\r\nThis implements an optimization to create the public instance on demand,\r\ninstead of eagerly creating it when creating the host node. We expect\r\nthis to improve performance by reducing the logic we do per node and the\r\nnumber of object allocations.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nManually synced the changes to React Native and run Fantom tests and\r\nbenchmarks, with the flag enabled and disabled. All tests pass in both\r\ncases, and benchmarks show a slight but consistent performance\r\nimprovement.",

See the prior PRs for how we handle server rendering and\r\nclient rendering. In this change we update the hydration implementation\r\nto be able to locate expected nodes. In particular this means hydration\r\nunderstands now that the default hydration context is the document body\r\nwhen the container is above the body.\r\n\r\nOne case that is unique to hydration is clearing Suspense boundaries.\r\nWhen hydration fails or when the server instructs the client to recover\r\nan errored boundary it's possible that the html, head, and body tags in\r\nthe initial document were written from a fallback or a different primary\r\ncontent on the server and need to be replaced by the client render.\r\nHowever these tags (and in the case of head, their content) won't be\r\ninside the comment nodes that identify the bounds of the Suspense\r\nboundary. And when client rendering you may not even render the same\r\nsingletons that were server rendered. So when server rendering a\r\nboudnary which contributes to the preamble (the html, head, and body tag\r\nopenings plus the head contents) we emit a special marker comment just\r\nbefore closing the boundary out. This marker encodes which parts of the\r\npreamble this boundary owned. If we need to clear the suspense boundary\r\non the client we read this marker and use it to reset the appropriate\r\nsingleton state.",

See https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/10082\n\nAlso updated the fixture to the latest Parcel canary. A few APIs have\nchanged. We do have a higher level library wrapper now (`@parcel/rsc`\nadded in https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/10074) but I left\nthe fixture using the lower level APIs directly here since it is easier\nto see how react-server-dom-parcel is used.",

Since the unmounts are tracked in the snapshot phase we\nneed some way to track the mounts before that.\n\nOriginally the way I did that is by reusing the render phase since there\nwas no other phase in the commit before that. However, that's not quite\ncorrect. Just because something is visited in render doesn't mean it'll\ncommit. E.g. if that tree ends up suspending or erroring.

When using an HTML entry point, this is done (as of the\nabove PR) via a native import map. This means that if a bundle's hash\nchanges, only that bundle will be invalidated (plus the HTML itself\nwhich typically has a short caching policy), not any other bundles that\nreference it.\n\nFor RSCs, we cannot currently use native import maps because of client\nside navigations, where a new HTML file is not requested. Eventually,\nmultiple `<script type=\"importmap\">` elements will be supported\n(https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10528) ([coming Chrome\n133](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5121916248260608)), at which point\nReact could potentially inject them. In the meantime, I've added some\nAPIs to Parcel to polyfill this. With this change, an import map can be\nsent along with a client reference, containing a mapping for any dynamic\nimports and URL dependencies (e.g. images) that are referenced by the JS\nbundles. On the client, the import map is extended with these new\nmappings prior to executing the referenced bundles. This preserves the\ncaching advantages described above while supporting client navigations.",

We make extensive use of in-place mutation of the IR, and the experiment proved that this we can get reasonable ergonomics for this in Rust which was cool. We've since ended up using some of the code here for Relay, allowing Relay Compiler to parse JS files to do more fine-grained extraction of data. For React Compiler though, we plan to continue using JavaScript and explore lightweight native wrappers for things like OXC and SWC plugins.

      "message": "Add Transition Types (#32105)\n\nThis adds an isomorphic API to add Transition Types, which represent the\ncause, to the current Transition. This is currently mainly for View\nTransitions but as a concept it's broader and we might expand it to more\nfeatures and object types in the future.\n\n```js\nimport { unstable_addTransitionType as addTransitionType } from 'react';\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n  addTransitionType('my-transition-type');\n  setState(...);\n});\n```\n\nIf multiple transitions get entangled this is additive and all\nTransition Types are collected. You can also add more than one type to a\nTransition (hence the `add` prefix).\n\nTransition Types are reset after each commit. Meaning that `<Suspense>`\nrevealing after a `startTransition` does not get any View Transition\ntypes associated with it.\n\nNote that the scoping rules for this is a little \"wrong\" in this\nimplementation. Ideally it would be scoped to the nearest outer\n`startTransition` and grouped with any `setState` inside of it.\nIncluding Actions. However, since we currently don't have AsyncContext\non the client, it would be too easy to drop a Transition Type if there\nwere no other `setState` in the same `await` task. Multiple Transitions\nare entangled together anyway right now as a result. So this just tracks\na global of all pending Transition Types for the next Transition. An\ninherent tricky bit with this API is that you could update multiple\nroots. In that case it should ideally be associated with each root.\nTransition Tracing solves this by associating a Transition with any\nupdates that are later collected but this suffers from the problem\nmentioned above. Therefore, I just associate Transition Types with one\nroot - the first one to commit. Since the View Transitions across roots\nare sequential anyway it kind of makes sense that only one really is the\ncause and the other one is subsequent.\n\nTransition Types can be used to apply different animations based on what\ncaused the Transition. You have three different ways to choose from for\nhow to use them:\n\n## CSS\n\nIt integrates with [View Transition\nTypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-view-transitions-2/#active-view-transition-pseudo-examples)\nso you can match different animations based on CSS scopes:\n\n```css\n:root:active-view-transition-type(my-transition-type) {\n  &::view-transition-...(...) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is kind of a PITA to write though and if you have a CSS library\nthat provide View Transition Classes it's difficult to import those into\nthese scopes.\n\n## Class per Type\n\nThis PR also adds an object-as-map form that can be passed to all\n`className` properties:\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition className={{\n  'my-navigation-type': 'hello',\n  'default': 'world',\n}}>\n```\n\nIf multiple types match, then they're joined together. If no types match\nthen the special `\"default\"` entry is used instead. If any type has the\nvalue `\"none\"` then that wins and the ViewTransition is disabled (not\nassigned a name).\n\nThese can be combined with `enter`/`exit`/`update`/`layout`/`share`\nprops to match based on kind of trigger and Transition Type.\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition enter={{\n  'navigation-back': 'enter-right',\n  'navigation-forward': 'enter-left',\n}}\nexit={{\n  'navigation-back': 'exit-right',\n  'navigation-forward': 'exit-left',\n}}>\n```\n\n## Events\n\nIn addition, you can also observe the types in the View Transition Event\ncallbacks as the second argument. That way you can pick different\nimperative Animations based on the cause.\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition onUpdate={(inst, types) => {\n  if (types.includes('navigation-back')) {\n    ...\n  } else if (types.includes('navigation-forward')) {\n    ...\n  } else {\n    ...\n  }\n}}>\n```\n\n## Future\n\nIn the future we might expose types to `useEffect` for more general\npurpose usage. This would also allow non-View Transition based\nAnimations such as existing libraries to use this same feature to\ncoordinate the same concept.\n\nWe might also allow richer objects to be passed along here. Only the\nstrings would apply to View Transitions but the imperative code and\neffects could do something else with them.",

      "message": "[Fizz] Support Suspense boundaries anywhere (#32069)\n\nSuspense is meant to be composable but there has been a lonstanding\r\nlimitation with using Suspense above the `<body>` tag of an HTML\r\ndocument due to peculiarities of how HTML is parsed. For instance if you\r\nused Suspense to render an entire HTML document and had a fallback that\r\nmight flush an alternate Document the comment nodes which describe this\r\nboundary scope won't be where they need to be in the DOM for client\r\nReact to properly hydrate them. This is somewhat a problem of our own\r\nmaking in that we have a concept of a Preamble and we leave the closing\r\nbody and html tags behind until streaming has completed which produces a\r\nvalid HTML document that also matches the DOM structure that would be\r\nparsed from it. However Preambles as a concept are too important to\r\nfeatures like Float to imagine moving away from this model and so we can\r\neither choose to just accept that you cannot use Suspense anywhere\r\nexcept inside the `<body>` or we can build special support for Suspense\r\ninto react-dom that has a coherent semantic with how HTML documents are\r\nwritten and parsed.\r\n\r\nThis change implements Suspense support for react-dom/server by\r\ncorrectly serializing boundaries during rendering, prerendering, and\r\nresumgin on the server. It does not yet support Suspense everywhere on\r\nthe client but this will arrive in a subsequent change. In practice\r\nSuspense cannot be used above the `<body>` tag today so this is not a\r\nbreaking change since no programs in the wild could be using this\r\nfeature anyway.\r\n\r\nReact's streaming rendering of HTML doesn't lend itself to replacing the\r\ncontents of the documentElement, head, or body of a Document. These are\r\nalready special cased in fiber as HostSingletons and similarly for Fizz\r\nthe values we render for these tags must never be updated by the Fizz\r\nruntime once written. To accomplish these we redefine the Preamble as\r\nthe tags that represent these three singletons plus the contents of the\r\ndocument.head. If you use Suspense above any part of the Preamble then\r\nnothing will be written to the destination until the boundary is no\r\nlonger pending. If the boundary completes then the preamble from within\r\nthat boudnary will be output. If the boundary postpones or errors then\r\nthe preamble from the fallback will be used instead.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, by default anything that is not part of the preamble is\r\nimplicitly in body scope. This leads to the somewhat counterintuitive\r\nconsequence that the comment nodes we use to mark the borders of a\r\nSuspense boundary in Fizz can appear INSIDE the preamble that was\r\nrendered within it.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nrender((\r\n  <Suspense>\r\n    <html lang=\"en\">\r\n      <body>\r\n        <div>hello world</div>\r\n      </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n  </Suspense>\r\n))\r\n```\r\nwill produce an HTML document like this\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head></head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <!--$--> <-- this is the comment Node representing the outermost Suspense\r\n    <div>hello world</div>\r\n    <$--/$-->\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater when I update Fiber to support Suspense anywhere hydration will\r\nsimilarly start implicitly in the document body when the root is part of\r\nthe preamble (the document or one of it's singletons).",

It's the interface that exists on Element that\nlets you start animations on it. These ones are like that but for the\nfour pseudo-elements created by the view transition.\n\nIf a name changes, then a new ref is created. That way if you hold onto\na ref during an exit animation spawned by the name change, you can keep\ncalling functions on it. It will keep referring to the old name rather\nthan the new name.\n\nThis allows imperative control over the animations instead of using CSS\nfor this.\n\n```js\nconst viewTransition = ref.current;\nconst groupAnimation = viewTransition.group.animate(keyframes, options);\nconst imagePairAnimation = viewTransition.imagePair.animate(keyframes, options);\nconst oldAnimation = viewTransition.old.animate(keyframes, options);\nconst newAnimation = viewTransition.new.animate(keyframes, options);\n```\n\nThe downside of using this API is that it doesn't work with SSR so for\nSSR rendered animations they'll fallback to the CSS. You could use this\nfor progressive enhancement though.\n\nNote: In this PR the ref only controls one DOM node child but there can\nbe more than one DOM node in the ViewTransition fragment and they are\njust left to their defaults. We could try something like making the\n`animate()` function apply to multiple children but that could lead to\nsome weird consequences and the return value would be difficult to\nmerge. We could try to maintain an array of Animatable that updates with\nhow ever many things are currently animating but that makes the API more\ncomplicated to use for the simple case. Conceptually this should be like\na fragment so we would ideally combine the multiple children into a\nsingle isolate if we could. Maybe one day the same name could be applied\nto multiple children to create a single isolate. For now I think I'll\njust leave it like this and you're really expect to just use it with one\nDOM node. If you have more than one they just get the default animations\nfrom CSS.\n\nUsing this is a little tricky due timing.

      "message": "ViewTransitions in Navigation (#32028)\n\nThis adds navigation support to the View Transition fixture using both\n`history.pushState/popstate` and the Navigation API models.\n\nBecause `popstate` does scroll restoration synchronously at the end of\nthe event, but `startViewTransition` cannot start synchronously, it\nwould observe the \"old\" state as after applying scroll restoration. This\nleads to weird artifacts. So we intentionally do not support View\nTransitions in `popstate`. If it suspends anyway for some other reason,\nthen scroll restoration is broken anyway and then it is supported. We\ndon't have to do anything here because this is already how things worked\nbecause the sync `popstate` special case already included the sync lane\nwhich opts it out of View Transitions.\n\nFor the Navigation API, scroll restoration can be blocked. The best way\nto do this is to resolve the Navigation API promise after React has\napplied its mutation. We can detect if there's currently any pending\nnavigation and wait to resolve the `startViewTransition` until it\nfinishes and any scroll restoration has been applied.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f53b3282-6315-4513-b3d6-b8981d66964e\n\nThere is a subtle thing here. If we read the viewport metrics before\nscroll restoration has been applied, then we might assume something is\nor isn't going to be within the viewport incorrectly. This is evident on\nthe \"Slide In from Left\" example. When we're going forward to that page\nwe shift the scroll position such that it's going to appear in the\nviewport. If we did this before applying scroll restoration, it would\nnot animate because it wasn't in the viewport then. Therefore, we need\nto run the after mutation phase after scroll restoration.\n\nA consequence of this is that you have to resolve Navigation in\n`useInsertionEffect` as otherwise it leads to a deadlock (which\neventually gets broken by `startViewTransition`'s timeout of 10\nseconds). Another consequence is that now `useLayoutEffect` observes the\nrestored state. However, I think what we'll likely do is move the layout\nphase to before the after mutation phase which also ensures that\nauto-scrolling inside `useLayoutEffect` are considered in the viewport\nmeasurements as well.",

It doesn't seamlessly transition into the new transition.\n\nThis is generally considered a bad thing but I actually think it's quite\ngood for fire-and-forget animations (gestures is another story). There\nare too many examples of bad animations in fast interactions because the\nscenario wasn't predicted. Like overlapping toasts or stacked layers\nthat look bad. The only case interrupts tend to work well is when you do\na strict reversal of an animation like returning to the page you just\nleft or exiting a modal just being opened. However, we're limited by the\nplatform even in that regard.\n\nI think one reason interruptions have traditionally been seen as good is\nbecause it's hard if you have a synchronous framework to not interrupt\nsince your application state has already moved on. We don't have that\nlimitation since we can suspend commits. We can do all the work to\nprepare for the next commit by rendering while the animation is going\nbut then delay the commit until the previous one finishes.\n\nAnother technical limitation earlier animation libraries suffered from\nis only have the option to either interrupt or sequence animations since\nit's modeling just one change set. Like showing one toast at a time.\nThat's bad. We don't have that limitation because we can interrupt a\npreviously suspended commit and start working on a new one instead.\nThat's what we do for suspended transitions in general. The net effect\nis that we batch the commits.\n\nTherefore if you get multiple toasts flying in fast, they can animate as\na batch in together all at once instead of overlapping slightly or being\nstaggered. Interruptions (often) bad. Staggered animations bad. Batched\nanimations good.\n\nThis PR stashes the currently active View Transition with an expando on\nthe container that's animating (currently always document). This is\nsimilar to what we do with event handlers etc. We reason we do this with\nan expando is that if you have multiple Reacts on the same page they\nneed to wait for each other. However, one of those might also be the SSR\nruntime. So this lets us wait for the SSR runtime's animations to finish\nbefore starting client ones. This could really be a more generic name\nsince this should ideally be shared across frameworks. It's kind of\nstrange that this property doesn't already exist in the DOM given that\nthere can only be one. It would be useful to be able to coordinate this\nacross libraries.",

These are\nonly available in the View Transitions v2 spec. When they're not\navailable it's better to fallback to just not animating instead of\nanimating with the wrong styling rules applied.\n\nThis is already widely supported in Chrome and Safari 18.2. Safari 18.2\nusage is still somewhat low but it's rolling out quickly as we speak.\n\nA way to detect this is by just passing the object form to\n`startViewTransition` which throws if it's an earlier version.

Therefore we're only indirectly detecting class support.\n\nThis means that in practice Safari 18.0 and 18.1 won't animate.

E.g.\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition className=\"enter-slide-in exit-fade-out update-cross-fade\">\n```\n\nThis doesn't change the HTML `class` attribute. It's not a CSS class.\nInstead it assign the `view-transition-class` style prop of the\nunderlying DOM node while it's transitioning.\n\nYou can also just use `<div style={{viewTransitionClass: ...}}>` on the\nDOM node but it's convenient to control the Transition completely from\nthe outside and conceptually we're transitioning the whole fragment. You\ncan even make Transition components that just wraps existing components.\n`<RevealTransition><Component /></RevealTransition>` this way.\n\nSince you can also have multiple wrappers for different circumstances it\nallows React's heuristics to use different classes for different\nscenarios.

[As seen in the fixture\nhere.](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/8b91b37bb8b4add5f3f8be5ef8f49bb23966b13b#diff-b4d9854171ffdac4d2c01be92a5eff4f8e9e761e6af953094f99ca243b054a85R11)\n\nI did notice an unfortunate bug in how CSS Modules (at least in Webpack)\ngenerates class names. Sometimes the `+` character is used in the hash\nof the class name which is not valid for `view-transition-class` and so\nit breaks. I had to rename my class names until the hash yielded\nsomething different to work around it. Ideally that bug gets fixed soon.\n\n## className, rly?\n\n`className` isn't exactly the most loved property name, however, I'm\nusing `className` here too for consistency. Even though in this case\nthere's no direct equivalent DOM property name. The CSS property is\nnamed `viewTransitionClass`, but the \"viewTransition\" prefix is implied\nby the Component it is on in this case. For most people the fact that\nthis is actually a different namespace than other CSS classes doesn't\nmatter. You'll most just use a CSS library anyway and conceptually\nyou're just assigning classes the same way as `className` on a DOM node.\n\nBut if we ever rename the `class` prop then we can do that for this one\nas well.",

      "message": "Add <ViewTransition> Component (#31975)\n\nThis will provide the opt-in for using [View\nTransitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API)\nin React.\n\nView Transitions only trigger for async updates like `startTransition`,\n`useDeferredValue`, Actions or `<Suspense>` revealing from fallback to\ncontent. Synchronous updates provide an opt-out but also guarantee that\nthey commit immediately which View Transitions can't.\n\nThere's no need to opt-in to View Transitions at the \"cause\" side like\nevent handlers or actions. They don't know what UI will change and\nwhether that has an animated transition described.\n\nConceptually the `<ViewTransition>` component is like a DOM fragment\nthat transitions its children in its own isolate/snapshot. The API works\nby wrapping a DOM node or inner component:\n\n```js\nimport {ViewTransition} from 'react';\n\n<ViewTransition><Component /></ViewTransition>\n```\n\nThe default is `name=\"auto\"` which will automatically assign a\n`view-transition-name` to the inner DOM node. That way you can add a\nView Transition to a Component without controlling its DOM nodes styling\notherwise.\n\nA difference between this and the browser's built-in\n`view-transition-name: auto` is that switching the DOM nodes within the\n`<ViewTransition>` component preserves the same name so this example\ncross-fades between the DOM nodes instead of causing an exit and enter:\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition>{condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />}</ViewTransition>\n```\n\nThis becomes especially useful with `<Suspense>` as this example\ncross-fades between Skeleton and Content:\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition>\n  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>\n    <Content />\n  </Suspense>\n</ViewTransition>\n```\n\nWhere as this example triggers an exit of the Skeleton and an enter of\nthe Content:\n\n```js\n<Suspense fallback={<ViewTransition><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>}>\n  <ViewTransition><Content /></ViewTransition>\n</Suspense>\n```\n\nManaging instances and keys becomes extra important.\n\nYou can also specify an explicit `name` property for example for\nanimating the same conceptual item from one page onto another. However,\nbest practices is to property namespace these since they can easily\ncollide. It's also useful to add an `id` to it if available.\n\n```js\n<ViewTransition name=\"my-shared-view\">\n```\n\nThe model in general is the same as plain `view-transition-name` except\nReact manages a set of heuristics for when to apply it. A problem with\nthe naive View Transitions model is that it overly opts in every\nboundary that *might* transition into transitioning. This is leads to\nunfortunate effects like things floating around when unrelated updates\nhappen. This leads the whole document to animate which means that\nnothing is clickable in the meantime. It makes it not useful for smaller\nand more local transitions. Best practice is to add\n`view-transition-name` only right before you're about to need to animate\nthe thing. This is tricky to manage globally on complex apps and is not\ncompositional. Instead we let React manage when a `<ViewTransition>`\n\"activates\" and add/remove the `view-transition-name`. This is also when\nReact calls `startViewTransition` behind the scenes while it mutates the\nDOM.\n\nI've come up with a number of heuristics that I think will make a lot\neasier to coordinate this. The principle is that only if something that\nupdates that particular boundary do we activate it. I hope that one day\nmaybe browsers will have something like these built-in and we can remove\nour implementation.\n\nA `<ViewTransition>` only activates if:\n\n- If a mounted Component renders a `<ViewTransition>` within it outside\nthe first DOM node, and it is within the viewport, then that\nViewTransition activates as an \"enter\" animation. This avoids inner\n\"enter\" animations trigger when the parent mounts.\n- If an unmounted Component had a `<ViewTransition>` within it outside\nthe first DOM node, and it was within the viewport, then that\nViewTransition activates as an \"exit\" animation. This avoids inner\n\"exit\" animations triggering when the parent unmounts.\n- If an explicitly named `<ViewTransition name=\"...\">` is deep within an\nunmounted tree and one with the same name appears in a mounted tree at\nthe same time, then both are activated as a pair, but only if they're\nboth in the viewport. This avoids these triggering \"enter\" or \"exit\"\nanimations when going between parents that don't have a pair.\n- If an already mounted `<ViewTransition>` is visible and a DOM\nmutation, that might affect how it's painted, happens within its\nchildren but outside any nested `<ViewTransition>`. This allows it to\n\"cross-fade\" between its updates.\n- If an already mounted `<ViewTransition>` resizes or moves as the\nresult of direct DOM nodes siblings changing or moving around. This\nallows insertion, deletion and reorders into a list to animate all\nchildren. It is only within one DOM node though, to avoid unrelated\nchanges in the parent to trigger this. If an item is outside the\nviewport before and after, then it's skipped to avoid things flying\nacross the screen.\n- If a `<ViewTransition>` boundary changes size, due to a DOM mutation\nwithin it, then the parent activates (or the root document if there are\nno more parents). This ensures that the container can cross-fade to\navoid abrupt relayout. This can be avoided by using absolutely\npositioned children. When this can avoid bubbling to the root document,\nwhatever is not animating is still responsive to clicks during the\ntransition.\n\nConceptually each DOM node has its own default that activates the parent\n`<ViewTransition>` or no transition if the parent is the root. That\nmeans that if you add a DOM node like `<div><ViewTransition><Component\n/></ViewTransition></div>` this won't trigger an \"enter\" animation since\nit was the div that was added, not the ViewTransition. Instead, it might\ncause a cross-fade of the parent ViewTransition or no transition if it\nhad no parent. This ensures that only explicit boundaries perform coarse\nanimations instead of every single node which is really the benefit of\nthe View Transitions model. This ends up working out well for simple\ncases like switching between two pages immediately while transitioning\none floating item that appears on both pages. Because only the floating\nitem transitions by default.\n\nNote that it's possible to add manual `view-transition-name` with CSS or\n`style={{ viewTransitionName: 'auto' }}` that always transitions as long\nas something else has a `<ViewTransition>` that activates. For example a\n`<ViewTransition>` can wrap a whole page for a cross-fade but inside of\nit an explicit name can be added to something to ensure it animates as a\nmove when something relates else changes its layout. Instead of just\ncross-fading it along with the Page which would be the default.\n\nThere's more PRs coming with some optimizations, fixes and expanded\nAPIs. This first PR explores the above core heuristic.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Sebastian \"Sebbie\" Silbermann <silbermann.sebastian@gmail.com>",

We need to be resilient to that.\n\nThis PR first refactors the flushMutationEffects and flushLayoutEffects\nto use module scope variables to track its arguments so we can defer\nthem. It shares these with how we were already doing it for\nflushPendingEffects.\n\nWe also track how far along the commit phase we are so we know what we\nhave left to flush.\n\nThen callers of flushPassiveEffects become flushPendingEffects. That\nhelper synchronously flushes any remaining phases we've yet to commit.\nThat ensure that things are at least consistent if that happens.\n\nFinally, when we are using a scheduled task, we don't do any work. This\nensures that we're not flushing any work too early if we could've\ndeferred it. This still ensures that we always do flush it before\nstarting any new work on any root so new roots observe the committed\nstate.\n\nThere are some unfortunate effects that could happen from allowing\nthings to flush eagerly. Such as if a flushSync sneaks in before\nstartViewTransition, it'll skip the animation. If it's during a\nsuspensey font it'll start the transition before the font has loaded\nwhich might be better than breaking flushSync. It'll also potentially\nflush passive effects inside the startViewTransition which should\ntypically be ok.",

This one we can only detect if it's from an\nevent that has a `window.event` since otherwise it's hard to know if\nwe're still in the same event.\n\n<img width=\"1210\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 11 38 44슗M\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee188bc4-8ebb-4e95-b5a5-4d724856c27d\"\n/>\n\nI decided against making a ping in a microtask considered a cascade.\nBecause that should ideally be using the Suspense Optimization and so\nwouldn't be considered multi-pass.\n\n<img width=\"1284\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 11 07 30슗M\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d173750-a475-41a0-b6cf-679d15c4ca97\"\n/>\n\nWe might consider making the whole render phase and maybe commit phase\nred but that should maybe reserved for actual errors. The \"Blocked\"\nphase really represents the `setState` and so will have the stack trace\nof the first update.",

      "message": "[Fiber] Yield every other frame for Transition/Retry work (#31828)\n\nThis flag first moves the `shouldYield()` logic into React itself. We\nneed this for `postTask` compatibility anyway since this logic is no\nlonger a concern of the scheduler. This means that there can also be no\nglobal `requestPaint()` that asks for painting earlier. So this is best\nrolled out with `enableAlwaysYieldScheduler` (and ideally\n`enableYieldingBeforePassive`) instead of `enableRequestPaint`.\n\nOnce in React we can change the yield timing heuristics. This uses the\nprevious 5ms for Idle work to keep everything responsive while doing\nbackground work. However, for Transitions and Retries we have seen that\nsame thread animations (like loading states animating, or constant\nanimations like cool Three.js stuff) can take CPU time away from the\nTransition that causes moving into new content to slow down. Therefore\nwe only yield every 25ms.\n\nThe purpose of this yield is not to avoid the overhead of yielding,\nwhich is very low, but rather to intentionally block any frequently\noccurring other main thread work like animations from starving our work.\nIf we could we could just tell everyone else to throttle their stuff for\nideal scheduling but that's not quite realistic. In other words, the\npurpose of this is to reduce the frame rate of animations to 30 fps and\nwe achieve this by not yielding. We still do yield to allow the\nanimations to not just stall. This seems like a good balance.\n\nThe 5ms of Idle is because we don't really need to yield less often\nsince the overhead is low. We keep it low to allow 120 fps animations to\nrun if necessary and our work may not be the only work within a frame so\nwe need to yield early enough to leave enough time left.\n\nSimilarly we choose 25ms rather than say 35ms to ensure that we push\nlong enough to guarantee to half the frame rate but low enough that\nthere's plenty of time left for a rAF to power each animation every\nother frame. It's also low enough that if something else interrupts the\nwork like a new interaction, we can still be responsive to that within\n50ms or so. We also need to yield in case there's I/O work that needs to\nget bounced through the main thread.\n\nThis flag is currently off everywhere since we have so many other\nscheduling flags but that means there's some urgency to roll those out\nfully so we can test this one. There's also some tests to update since\nthis doesn't go through the Mock scheduler anymore for yields.",

Just like the phase itself is marked as green.\n\nIf the boundary client rendered we instead mark it as \"errored\" and its\nchildren given the plain primary render color (blue). I also collect the\nhydration error for this case so we can include its message in the\ndetails view.

That\nmeans that if you have a fast commit phase, it might try to squeeze in\nthe passive effects in the same frame but those then might end being\nvery heavy.\n\nWe had `requestPaint()` for this but that was only implemented for the\n`isInputPending` experiment. It wasn't thought we needed it for the\nregular scheduler because it yields \"every frame\" anyway - but it\ndoesn't yield every task. While the `isInputPending` experiment showed\nthat it wasn't actually any significant impact, and it was better to\nkeep shorter yield time anyway. Which is why we deleted the code.\nWhatever small win it did see in some cases might have been actually due\nto this issue rather than anything to do with `isInputPending` at all.\n\nAs you can see in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31782 we do\nhave this implemented in the mock scheduler and a lot of behavior that\nwe assert assumes that this works.\n\nSo this just implements yielding after `requestPaint` is called.\n\nBefore:\n\n<img width=\"1023\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-14 at 3 40 24슗M\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d60f4bb2-c8f8-4f91-a402-9ac25b278450\"\n/>\n\nAfter:\n\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-14 at 3 41 25슗M\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/170cdb90-a049-436f-9501-be3fb9bc04ca\"\n/>\n\nNotice how in after the native task is split into two. It might not\nalways actually paint and the native scheduler might make the same\nmistake and think it has enough time left but it's at least less likely\nto.\n\nWe do have another way to do this. When we yield a continuation we also\nyield to the native browser. This is to enable the Suspense Optimization\n(currently disabled) to work. We could do the same for passive effects\nand, in fact, I have a branch that does but because that requires a lot\nmore tests to be fixed it's a lot more invasive of a change. The nice\nthing about this approach is that this is not even running in tests at\nall and the tests we do have assert that this is the behavior already. 游땳",

It's actually a client render. If we get any other\nupdates flowing in from above at the same time we might as well do them\nin the same pass instead of two passes.

      "message": "[DevTools] Show component names while highlighting renders (#31577)\n\n## Summary\r\nThis PR improves the Trace Updates feature by letting developers see\r\ncomponent names directly on the update overlay. Before this change, the\r\noverlay only highlighted updated regions, leaving it unclear which\r\ncomponents were involved. With this update, you can now match visual\r\nupdates to their corresponding components, making it much easier to\r\ndebug rendering performance.\r\n\r\n### New Feature: Show component names while highlighting\r\nWhen the new **\"Show component names while highlighting\"** setting is\r\nenabled, the update overlay display the names of affected components\r\nabove the rectangles, along with the update count. This gives immediate\r\ncontext about what뗩 rendering and why. The preference is stored in\r\nlocal storage and synced with the backend, so it뗩 remembered across\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\n### Improvements to Drawing Logic\r\nThe drawing logic has been updated to make the overlay sharper and\r\neasier to read. Overlay now respect device pixel ratios, so they look\r\ngreat on high-DPI screens. Outlines have also been made crisper, which\r\nmakes it easier to spot exactly where updates are happening.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> **Grouping Logic and Limitations**\r\n> Updates are grouped by their screen position `(left, top coordinates)`\r\nto combine overlapping or nearby regions into a single group. Groups are\r\nsorted by the highest update count within each group, making the most\r\nfrequently updated components stand out.\r\n> Overlapping labels may still occur when multiple updates involve\r\ncomponents that overlap but are not in the exact same position. This is\r\nintentional, as the logic aims to maintain a straightforward mapping\r\nbetween update regions and component names without introducing\r\nunnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis PR also adds tests for the new `groupAndSortNodes` utility, which\r\nhandles the logic for grouping and sorting updates. The tests ensure the\r\nbehavior is reliable across different scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Before & After\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ea0fe3e-9354-44fa-95f3-9a867554f74c\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32af4d98-92a5-47dd-a732-f05c2293e41b\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ruslan Lesiutin <rdlesyutin@gmail.com>",

This ensures that we're always hydrating using\r\na Hydration Lane or the Offscreen Lane rather than other lanes getting\r\nsome random hydration in it.\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue where updating a root while it is still hydrating\r\ncauses it to trigger client rendering when it could just hydrate and\r\nthen apply the update on top of that.\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a potential performance issue where\r\n`unstable_scheduleHydration` gets batched with an update that then ends\r\nup forcing an update of a boundary that requires it to rewind to do the\r\nhydration lane anyway. Might as well just start with the hydration\r\nwithout the update applied first.\r\n\r\nI added a kill switch (`enableHydrationLaneScheduling`) just in case but\r\nseems very safe given that using `unstable_scheduleHydration` at all is\r\nvery rare and updating the root before the shell hydrates is extremely\r\nrare (and used to trigger a recoverable error).",

Now what is\r\nconceptually a blocking child is kind of undefined in RSC. E.g. if\r\nyou're not using a Promise on the client, or if it is wrapped in\r\nSuspense, is it really blocking the parent?\r\n\r\nHere I reconstruct parent-child relationship by which chunks reference\r\nother chunks. A child can belong to more than one parent like when we\r\ndedupe the result of a Server Component.\r\n\r\nThen I wait until the whole RSC payload has streamed in, and then I\r\ntraverse the tree collecting the end time from children as I go and emit\r\nthe `performance.measure()` calls on the way up.\r\n\r\nThere's more work for this visualization in follow ups but this is the\r\nbasics. For example, since the Server Component time span includes async\r\nwork it's possible for siblings to execute their span in parallel (Foo\r\nand Bar in the screenshot are parallel siblings). To deal with this we\r\nneed to spawn parallel work into separate tracks. Each one can be deep\r\ndue to large trees. This can makes this type of visualization unwieldy\r\nwhen you have a lot of parallelism. Therefore I also plan another\r\nflatter Timeline visualization in a follow up.",

It is mostly copied from the\r\nexisting webpack/turbopack integrations, with some changes to utilize\r\nParcel runtime APIs for loading and executing bundles/modules.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/10043 for the Parcel\r\nside of this, which includes the plugin needed to generate client and\r\nserver references. https://github.com/parcel-bundler/rsc-examples also\r\nincludes examples of various ways to use RSCs with Parcel.\r\n\r\nDifferences from other integrations:\r\n\r\n* Client and server modules are all part of the same graph, and we use\r\nParcel's\r\n[environments](https://parceljs.org/plugin-system/transformer/#the-environment)\r\nto distinguish them. The server is the Parcel build entry point, and it\r\nimports and renders server components in route handlers. When a `\"use\r\nclient\"` directive is seen, the environment changes and Parcel creates a\r\nnew client bundle for the page, combining all client modules together.\r\nCSS from both client and server components are also combined\r\nautomatically.\r\n* There is no separate manifest file that needs to be passed around by\r\nthe user. A [Runtime](https://parceljs.org/plugin-system/runtime/)\r\nplugin injects client and server references as needed into the relevant\r\nbundles, and registers server action ids using `react-server-dom-parcel`\r\nautomatically.\r\n* A special `<Resources>` component is also generated by Parcel to\r\nrender the `<script>` and `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` elements needed for\r\na page, using the relevant info from the bundle graph.\r\n\r\nNote: I've already published a 0.0.x version of this package to npm for\r\ntesting purposes but happy to add whoever needs access to it as well.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n* How to test this in the React repo. I'll have integration tests in\r\nParcel, but setting up all the different mocks and environments to\r\nsimulate that here seems challenging. I could try to copy how\r\nWebpack/Turbopack do it but it's a bit different.\r\n* Where to put TypeScript types. Right now I have some ambient types in\r\nmy [example\r\nrepo](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/rsc-examples/blob/main/types.d.ts)\r\nbut it would be nice for users not to copy and paste these. Can I\r\ninclude them in the package or do they need to maintained separately in\r\ndefinitelytyped? I would really prefer not to have to maintain code in\r\nthree different repos ideally.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Sebastian Markbage <sebastian@calyptus.eu>",

      "message": "Update ReactDebugInfo types to declare timing info separately (#31714)\n\nThis clarifies a few things by ensuring that there is always at least\r\none required field. This can be used to refine the object to one of the\r\nspecific types. However, it's probably just a matter of time until we\r\nmake this tagged unions instead. E.g. it would be nice to rename the\r\n`name` field `ReactComponentInfo` to `type` and tag it with the React\r\nElement symbol because then it's just the same as a React Element.\r\n\r\nI also extract a time field. The idea is that this will advance (or\r\nrewind) the time to the new timestamp and then anything below would be\r\ndefined as happening within that time stamp. E.g. to model the start and\r\nend for a server component you'd do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {time: 123},\r\n  {name: 'Component', ... },\r\n  {time: 124},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason this needs to be in the `ReactDebugInfo` is so that timing\r\ninformation from one environment gets transferred into the next\r\nenvironment. It lets you take a Promise from one world and transfer it\r\ninto another world and its timing information is preserved without\r\neverything else being preserved.\r\n\r\nI've gone back and forth on if this should be part of each other Info\r\nobject like `ReactComponentInfo` but since those can be deduped and can\r\nchange formats (e.g. this should really just be a React Element) it's\r\nbetter to store this separately.\r\n\r\nThe time format is relative to a `timeOrigin` which is the current\r\nenvironment's `timeOrigin`. When it's serialized between environments\r\nthis needs to be considered.\r\n\r\nEmitting these timings is not yet implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: eps1lon <sebastian.silbermann@vercel.com>",

      "message": "Client render dehydrated Suspense boundaries on document load (#31620)\n\nWhen streaming SSR while hydrating React will wait for Suspense\r\nboundaries to be revealed by the SSR stream before attempting to hydrate\r\nthem. The rationale here is that the Server render is likely further\r\nahead of whatever the client would produce so waiting to let the server\r\nstream in the UI is preferable to retrying on the client and possibly\r\ndelaying how quickly the primary content becomes available. However If\r\nthe connection closes early (user hits stop for instance) or there is a\r\nserver error which prevents additional HTML from being delivered to the\r\nclient this can put React into a broken state where the boundary never\r\nresolves nor errors and the hydration never retries that boundary\r\nfreezing it in it's fallback state.\r\n\r\nOnce the document has fully loaded we know there is not way any\r\nadditional Suspense boundaries can arrive. This update changes react-dom\r\non the client to schedule client renders for any unfinished Suspense\r\nboundaries upon document loading.\r\n\r\nThe technique for client rendering a fallback is pretty straight\r\nforward. When hydrating a Suspense boundary if the Document is in\r\n'complete' readyState we interpret pending boundaries as fallback\r\nboundaries. If the readyState is not 'complete' we register an event to\r\nretry the boundary when the DOMContentLoaded event fires.\r\n\r\nTo test this I needed JSDOM to model readyState. We previously had a\r\ntemporary implementation of readyState for SSR streaming but I ended up\r\nimplementing this as a mock of JSDOM that implements a fake readyState\r\nthat is mutable. It starts off in 'loading' readyState and you can\r\nadvance it by mutating document.readyState. You can also reset it to\r\n'loading'. It fires events when changing states.\r\n\r\nThis seems like the least invasive way to get closer-to-real-browser\r\nbehavior in a way that won't require remembering this subtle detail\r\nevery time you create a test that asserts Suspense resolution order.",

      "message": "Add moveBefore Experiment (#31596)\n\nA long standing issue for React has been that if you reorder stateful\r\nnodes, they may lose their state and reload. The thing moving loses its\r\nstate. There's no way to solve this in general where two stateful nodes\r\nswap.\r\n\r\nThe [`moveBefore()`\r\nproposal](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5135990159835136?gate=5177450351558656)\r\nhas now moved to\r\n[intent-to-ship](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/YE_xLH6MkRs/m/_7CD0NYMAAAJ).\r\nThis function is kind of like `insertBefore` but preserves state.\r\n\r\nThere's [a demo here](https://state-preserving-atomic-move.glitch.me/).\r\nIdeally we'd port this demo to a fixture so we can try it.\r\n\r\nCurrently this flag is always off - even in experimental. That's because\r\nthis is still behind a Chrome flag so it's a little early to turn it on\r\neven in experimental. So you need a custom build. It's on in RN but only\r\nbecause it doesn't apply there which makes it easier to tell that it's\r\nsafe to ship once it's on everywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe other reason it's still off is because there's currently a semantic\r\nbreaking change. `moveBefore()` errors if both nodes are disconnected.\r\nThat happens if we're inside a completely disconnected React root.\r\nThat's not usually how you should use React because it means effects\r\ncan't read layout etc. However, it is currently supported. To handle\r\nthis we'd have to try/catch the `moveBefore` to handle this case but we\r\nhope this semantic will change before it ships. Before we turn this on\r\nin experimental we either have to wait for the implementation to not\r\nerror in the disconnected-disconnected case in Chrome or we'd have to\r\nadd try/catch.",

We do not plan to ship this as-is, and may not\r\nstart by going after direct `useEffect` calls. Until we make that\r\ndecision, the heuristic I use to detect when to insert effect deps will\r\nsuffice for testing.\r\n\r\nThe approach is simple: when we see a useEffect call with no dep array\r\nwe insert the deps inferred for the lambda passed in. If the first\r\nargument is not a lambda then we do not do anything.\r\n\r\nThis diff is the easy part. I think the harder part will be ensuring\r\nthat we can infer the deps even when we have to bail out of memoization.\r\nWe have no other features that *must* run regardless of rules of react\r\nviolations.

The event time of this new\r\nrender will be before the last render finished.\r\n\r\nWe usually clamp these but in this scenario the update doesn't happen\r\nwhile a render is happening.

Those needs to finalize too.\r\nReally this should be modeled as a suspended track that we haven't added\r\nyet. That's the gap between \"Blocked\" and \"message\" below.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1471\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-13 at 12 31 34슈M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24f994e-9055-4b10-ad29-ad9b36302ffc\">\r\n\r\nI also fixed an issue where we may log the same event name multiple\r\ntimes if we're rendering more than once in the same event. In this case\r\nI just leave a blank trace between the last commit and the next update.\r\n\r\nI also adding ignoring of the \"message\" event at all in these cases when\r\nthe event is from React's scheduling itself.",

I tracked it down to `console.error()` calls coming from\r\nApollo Client where one of the arguments is an object without a\r\nprototype (created with `Object.create(null)`). This causes\r\n`formatConsoleArgumentsToSingleString()` in React's devtools to error as\r\nthe function does not defend against `String()` throwing an error.\r\n\r\nMy attempted fix is to introduce a `safeToString` function (naming\r\nsuggestions appreciated) which expects `String()` to throw on certain\r\nobject and in that case falls back to returning `[object Object]`, which\r\nis what `String({})` would return.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test.",

The strategy in browsers is more correct\r\nwhere the display is responsible for source maps.\r\n\r\nThat's why we disable any custom `prepareStackTrace` like the ones added\r\nby `source-map`. We reset it to `undefined`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when running node with `--enable-source-maps` the default for\r\n`prepareStackTrace` which is a V8 feature (but may exist elsewhere too\r\nlike Bun) is a source mapped version of the stack. In those environments\r\nwe need to reset it to a default implementation that doesn't apply\r\nsource maps.\r\n\r\nWe already did this in Flight using the `ReactFlightStackConfigV8.js`\r\nconfig. However, we need this more generally in the\r\n`shared/ReactComponentStackFrame` implementation.\r\n\r\nWe could always set it to the default implementation instead of\r\n`undefined` but that's unnecessary code in browser builds and it might\r\nlead to slightly different results. For safety and code size, this PR\r\ndoes it with a fork instead.\r\n\r\nAll builds specific to `node` or `edge` (or `markup` which is a server\r\nfeature) gets the default implementation where as everything else (e.g.\r\nbrowsers) get `undefined` since it's expected that this is not source\r\nmapped. We don't have to do anything about the equivalent in React\r\nDevTools since React DevTools doesn't run on the server.",

      "message": "Fix Ref Lifecycles in Hidden Subtrees (#31379)\n\n## Summary\r\n\r\nWe're seeing certain situations in React Native development where ref\r\ncallbacks in `<Activity mode=\"hidden\">` are sometimes invoked exactly\r\nonce with `null` without ever being called with a \"current\" value.\r\n\r\nThis violates the contract for refs because refs are expected to always\r\nattach before detach (and to always eventually detach after attach).\r\nThis is *particularly* bad for refs that return cleanup functions,\r\nbecause refs that return cleanup functions expect to never be invoked\r\nwith `null`. This bug causes such refs to be invoked with `null`\r\n(because since `safelyAttachRef` was never called, `safelyDetachRef`\r\nthinks the ref does not return a cleanup function and invokes it with\r\n`null`).\r\n\r\nThis fix makes use of `offscreenSubtreeWasHidden` in\r\n`commitDeletionEffectsOnFiber`, similar to how\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/commit/ec52a5698e2dfea7050a0b015f0b79abfb2d81b7\r\ndid this for `commitDeletionEffectsOnFiber`.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nWe were able to isolate the repro steps to isolate the React Native\r\nexperimental changes.

(We have evidence that this bug occurs without Fast\r\nRefresh in real product implementations. However, we have not\r\nsuccessfully deduced the root cause, yet.)\r\n\r\nThis PR currently includes a unit test that reproduces the Fast Refresh\r\nscenario, which is also demonstrated in this CodeSandbox:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/hungry-darkness-33wxy7\r\n\r\nVerified unit tests pass:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yarn\r\n$ yarn test\r\n# Run with `-r=www-classic` for `enableScopeAPI` tests.\r\n$ yarn test -r=www-classic\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerified on the internal React Native development branch that the bug no\r\nlonger repros.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Rick Hanlon <rickhanlonii@fb.com>",

      "message": "JSX Outlining (#30956)\n\nCurrently, the react compiler can not compile within callbacks which can\r\npotentially cause over rendering. Consider this example:\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Component(countries, onDelete) {\r\n  const name = useFoo();\r\n  return countries.map(() => {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Foo>\r\n        <Bar name={name}/>\r\n        <Baz onclick={onDelete} />\r\n      </Foo>\r\n    );\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, there's no memoization of the nested jsx elements. But\r\ninstead if we were to manually refactor the nested jsx into separate\r\ncomponent like this:\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Component(countries, onDelete) {\r\n  const name = useFoo();\r\n  return countries.map(() => {\r\n    return <Temp name={name} onDelete={onDelete} />;\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Temp({ name, onDelete }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Foo>\r\n      <Bar name={name} />\r\n      <Baz onclick={onDelete} />\r\n    </Foo>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler can now optimise both these components:\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Component(countries, onDelete) {\r\n  const $ = _c(4);\r\n  const name = useFoo();\r\n  let t0;\r\n  if ($[0] !== name || $[1] !== onDelete || $[2] !== countries) {\r\n    t0 = countries.map(() => <Temp name={name} onDelete={onDelete} />);\r\n    $[0] = name;\r\n    $[1] = onDelete;\r\n    $[2] = countries;\r\n    $[3] = t0;\r\n  } else {\r\n    t0 = $[3];\r\n  }\r\n  return t0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Temp(t0) {\r\n  const $ = _c(7);\r\n  const { name, onDelete } = t0;\r\n  let t1;\r\n  if ($[0] !== name) {\r\n    t1 = <Bar name={name} />;\r\n    $[0] = name;\r\n    $[1] = t1;\r\n  } else {\r\n    t1 = $[1];\r\n  }\r\n  let t2;\r\n  if ($[2] !== onDelete) {\r\n    t2 = <Baz onclick={onDelete} />;\r\n    $[2] = onDelete;\r\n    $[3] = t2;\r\n  } else {\r\n    t2 = $[3];\r\n  }\r\n  let t3;\r\n  if ($[4] !== t1 || $[5] !== t2) {\r\n    t3 = (\r\n      <Foo>\r\n        {t1}\r\n        {t2}\r\n      </Foo>\r\n    );\r\n    $[4] = t1;\r\n    $[5] = t2;\r\n    $[6] = t3;\r\n  } else {\r\n    t3 = $[6];\r\n  }\r\n  return t3;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when `countries` is updated by adding one single value, only the\r\nnewly added value is re-rendered and not the entire list. Rather than\r\nhaving to do this manually, this PR teaches the react compiler to do\r\nthis transformation.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new pass (`OutlineJsx`) to capture nested jsx statements\r\nand outline them in a separate component. This newly outlined component\r\ncan then by memoized by the compiler, giving us more fine grained\r\nrendering.",

      "message": "[compiler] Allow refs to be lazily initialized during render\n\nSummary:\nThe official guidance for useRef notes an exception to the rule that refs cannot be accessed during render: to avoid recreating the ref's contents, you can test that the ref is uninitialized and then initialize it using an if statement:\n\n```\nif (ref.current == null) {\n  ref.current = SomeExpensiveOperation()\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler didn't recognize this exception, however, leading to code that obeyed all the official guidance for refs being rejected by the compiler. This PR fixes that, by extending the ref validation machinery with an awareness of guard operations that allow lazy initialization. We now understand `== null` and similar operations, when applied to a ref and consumed by an if terminal, as marking the consequent of the if as a block in which the ref can be safely written to. In order to do so we need to create a notion of ref ids, which link different usages of the same ref via both the ref and the ref value.\n\nghstack-source-id: d2729274f351e1eb0268f28f629fa4c2568ebc4d\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31188",

In some later analyses, we might wish to know whether a phi is reactive, but we don't have an easy way to do that currently.\n\nMost of the changes here is just replacing phi.id with phi.place.identifier and such. Interesting bits are EnterSSA (several functions now take places rather than identifiers, and InferReactivePlaces now needs to mark places as reactive explicitly.\n\nghstack-source-id: 5f4fb396cd86b421008c37832a5735ac40f8806e\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31171",

We've been doing this for React Native, for\r\nexample, which would significantly regress perf of recording a profiling\r\nsession, but we were not even using this data.\r\n2. Currently, we are generating component stack for every state update\r\nevent. This is extremely expensive, and we should not be doing this.\r\n\r\nWe can't currently fix the second one, because we would still need to\r\ngenerate all these stacks, and this would still take quite a lot of\r\ntime. As of right now, we can't generate a component stack lazily\r\nwithout relying on the fact that reference to the Fiber is not stale.\r\nWith `enableOwnerStacks` we could populate component stacks in some\r\ncollection, which would be cached at the Backend, and then returned only\r\nonce Frontend asks for it. This approach also eliminates the need for\r\nkeeping a reference to a Fiber.",

      "message": "fix[react-devtools]: remove all listeners when Agent is shutdown (#31151)\n\nBased on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31049, credits to\r\n@EdmondChuiHW.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening here:\r\n1. Once Agent is destroyed, unsubscribe own listeners and bridge\r\nlisteners.\r\n2. [Browser extension only] Once Agent is destroyed, unsubscribe\r\nlisteners from BackendManager.\r\n3. [Browser extension only] I've discovered that `backendManager.js`\r\ncontent script can get injected multiple times by the browser. When\r\nFrontend is initializing, it will create Store first, and then execute a\r\ncontent script for bootstraping backend manager. If Frontend was\r\ndestroyed somewhere between these 2 steps, Backend won't be notified,\r\nbecause it is not initialized yet, so it will not unsubscribe listeners\r\ncorrectly. We might end up duplicating listeners, and the next time\r\nFrontend is launched, it will report an issues \"Cannot add / remove node\r\n...\", because same operations are emitted twice.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce 3 you can do the following:\r\n1. Click reload-to-profile\r\n2. Right after when both app and Chrome DevTools panel are reloaded,\r\nclose Chrome DevTools.\r\n3. Open Chrome DevTools again, open Profiler panel and observe \"Cannot\r\nadd / remove node ...\" error in the UI.",

We want to evaluate whether the\r\nbase identifier is mutable within the context of the *outermost\r\nfunction*. This is because all LoadLocals and PropertyLoads within a\r\nnested function declaration have mutable-ranges within the context of\r\nthe function, but the base identifier is a context variable.\r\n- A side effect is that we no longer infer loads from props / other\r\nfunction arguments as mutable in edge cases (e.g. props escaping out of\r\ntry-blocks or being assigned to context variables)",

      "message": "[compiler] Optional chaining for dependencies (HIR rewrite)\n\nAdds HIR version of `PropagateScopeDeps` to handle optional chaining.\n\nInternally, this improves memoization on ~4% of compiled files (internal links: [1](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/paste/P1610406497/))\n\nSummarizing the changes in this PR.\n1. `CollectOptionalChainDependencies` recursively traverses optional blocks down to the base. From the base, we build up a set of `baseIdentifier.propertyA?.propertyB` mappings.\nThe tricky bit here is that optional blocks sometimes reference other optional blocks that are *not* part of the same chain e.g. a(c?.d)?.d. See code + comments in `traverseOptionalBlock` for how we avoid concatenating unrelated blocks.\n\n2. Adding optional chains into non-null object calculation.\n(Note that marking `a?.b` as 'non-null' means that `a?.b.c` is safe to evaluate, *not* `(a?.b).c`. Happy to rename this / reword comments accordingly if there's a better term)\nThis pass is split into two stages. (1) collecting non-null objects by block and (2) propagating non-null objects across blocks. The only significant change here was to (2). We add an extra reduce step `X=Reduce(Union(X, Intersect(X_neighbors)))` to merge optional and non-optional nodes (e.g. nonNulls=`{a, a?.b}` reduces to `{a, a.b}`)\n\n3. Adding optional chains into dependency calculation.\nThis was the trickiest. We need to take the \"maximal\" property chain as a dependency. Prior to this PR, we avoided taking subpaths e.g. `a.b` of `a.b.c` as dependencies by only visiting non-PropertyLoad/LoadLocal instructions. This effectively only recorded the property-path at site-of-use.\n\n    Unfortunately, this *quite* doesn't work for optional chains for a few reasons:\n    - We would need to skip relevant `StoreLocal`/`Branch terminal` instructions (but only those within optional blocks that have been successfully read).\n    - Given an optional chain, either (1) only a subpath or (2) the entire path can be represented as a PropertyLoad. We cannot directly add the last hoistable optional-block as a dependency as MethodCalls are an edge case e.g. given a?.b.c(), we should depend on `a?.b`, not `a?.b.c`\n      This means that we add its dependency at either the innermost unhoistable optional-block or when encountering it within its phi-join.\n\n4. Handle optional chains in DeriveMinimalDependenciesHIR.\nThis was also a bit tricky to formulate. Ideally, we would avoid a 2^3 case join (cond | uncond cfg, optional | not optional load, access | dependency). This PR attempts to simplify by building two trees\n    1. First add each hoistable path into a tree containing `Optional | NonOptional` nodes.\n    2. Then add each dependency into another tree containing `Optional | NonOptional`, `Access | Dependency` nodes, truncating the dependency at the earliest non-hoistable node (i.e. non-matching pair when walking the hoistable tree)\n\nghstack-source-id: a2170f26280dfbf65a4893d8a658f863a0fd0c88\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31037",

Calling `installHook` is not necessary inside `standalone.js`,\r\nbecause this script is running inside Electron wrapper (which is just a\r\nUI, not the app that we are debugging). We will loose the ability to use\r\nReact DevTools on this React application, but I guess thats fine.",

Instead of keeping `showInlineWarningsAndErrors` in `Settings`\r\ncontext (which was removed in\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30610), `Store` will now have a\r\nboolean flag, which controls if the UI should be displaying information\r\nabout errors and warnings.\r\n2. The errors and warnings counters in the Tree view are now counting\r\nonly unique errors. This makes more sense, because it is part of the\r\nElements Tree view, so ideally it should be showing number of components\r\nwith errors and number of components of warnings. Consider this example:\r\n2.1. Warning for element `A` was emitted once and warning for element\r\n`B` was emitted twice.\r\n2.2. With previous implementation, we would show `3 丘멆잺`, because in\r\ntotal there were 3 warnings in total. If user tries to iterate through\r\nthese, it will only take 2 steps to do the full cycle, because there are\r\nonly 2 elements with warnings (with one having same warning, which was\r\nemitted twice).\r\n2.3 With current implementation, we would show `2 丘멆잺`. Inspecting the\r\nelement with doubled warning will still show the warning counter (2)\r\nbefore the warning message.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the feature correctly works.\r\nhttps://fburl.com/a7fw92m4",

      "message": "[Fiber] Track Event Time, startTransition Time and setState Time (#31008)\n\nThis tracks the current window.event.timeStamp the first time we\r\nsetState or call startTransition. For either the blocking track or\r\ntransition track. We can use this to show how long we were blocked by\r\nother events or overhead from when the user interacted until we got\r\ncalled into React.\r\n\r\nThen we track the time we start awaiting a Promise returned from\r\nstartTransition. We can use this track how long we waited on an Action\r\nto complete before setState was called.\r\n\r\nThen finally we track when setState was called so we can track how long\r\nwe were blocked by other word before we could actually start rendering.\r\nFor a Transition this might be blocked by Blocking React render work.\r\n\r\nWe only log these once a subsequent render actually happened. If no\r\nrender was actually scheduled, then we don't log these. E.g. if an\r\nisomorphic Action doesn't call startTransition there's no render so we\r\ndon't log it.\r\n\r\nWe only log the first event/update/transition even if multiple are\r\nbatched into it later. If multiple Actions are entangled they're all\r\ntreated as one until an update happens. If no update happens and all\r\nentangled actions finish, we clear the transition so that the next time\r\na new sequence starts we can log it.\r\n\r\nWe also clamp these (start the track later) if they were scheduled\r\nwithin a render/commit. Since we share a single track we don't want to\r\ncreate overlapping tracks.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this is not to show every event/action that happens but\r\nto show a prelude to how long we were blocked before a render started.\r\nSo you can follow the first event to commit.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-20 at 1 59 58슈M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/151ba9e8-6b3c-4fa1-9f8d-e3602745eeb7\">\r\n\r\nI still need to add the rendering/suspended phases to the timeline which\r\nwhy this screenshot has a gap.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"993\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-20 at 12 50 27슈M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/155b6675-b78a-4a22-a32b-212c15051074\">\r\n\r\nIn this case it's a Form Action which started a render into the form\r\nwhich then suspended on the action.

Because of this, having `require` statement for\r\n`react-devtools-core` package was enough to initialize the React\r\nDevTools global hook on the `window`.\r\n\r\nNow, the Hook can actually receive an argument - initial user settings\r\nfor console patching.

      "message": "[compiler] Improve handling of refs\n\nSummary:\nThis change expands our handling of refs to build an understanding of nested refs within objects and functions that may return refs. It builds a special-purpose type system within the ref analysis that gives a very lightweight structural type to objects and array expressions (merging the types of all their members), and then propagating those types throughout the analysis (e.g., if `ref` has type `Ref`, then `{ x: ref }` and `[ref]` have type `Structural(value=Ref)` and `{x: ref}.anything` and `[ref][anything]` have type `Ref`).\n\nThis allows us to support structures that contain refs, and functions that operate over them, being created and passed around during rendering without at runtime accessing a ref value.\n\nThe analysis here uses a fixpoint to allow types to be fully propagated through the system, and we defend against diverging by widening the type of a variable if it could grow infinitely: so, in something like\n```\nlet x = ref;\nwhile (condition) {\n  x = [x]\n}\n```\nwe end up giving `x` the type `Structural(value=Ref)`.\n\nghstack-source-id: afb0b0cb014ffcf21ef4d0ede6511330fd975ec3\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30902",

      "message": "[Fiber] Log Component Renders to Custom Performance Track (#30967)\n\nStacked on #30960 and #30966. Behind the enableComponentPerformanceTrack\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step of performance logging. This logs the start and\r\nend time of a component render in the passive effect phase. We use the\r\ndata we're already tracking on components when the Profiler component or\r\nDevTools is active in the Profiling or Dev builds. By backdating this\r\nafter committing we avoid adding more overhead in the hot path. By only\r\nlogging things that actually committed, we avoid the costly unwinding of\r\nan interrupted render which was hard to maintain in earlier versions.\r\n\r\nWe already have the start time but we don't have the end time. That's\r\nbecause `actualStartTime + actualDuration` isn't enough since\r\n`actualDuration` counts the actual CPU time excluding yields and\r\nsuspending in the render.\r\n\r\nInstead, we infer the end time to be the start time of the next sibling\r\nor the complete time of the whole root if there are no more siblings. We\r\nneed to pass this down the passive effect tree. This will mean that any\r\noverhead and yields are attributed to this component's span. In a follow\r\nup, we'll need to start logging these yields to make it clear that this\r\nis not part of the component's self-time.\r\n\r\nIn follow ups, I'll do the same for commit phases. We'll also need to\r\nlog more information about the phases in the top track. We'll also need\r\nto filter out more components from the trees that we don't need to\r\nhighlight like the internal Offscreen components. It also needs polish\r\non colors etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I place the components into separate tracks depending on\r\nwhich lane currently committed. That way you can see what was blocking\r\nTransitions or Suspense etc. One problem that I've hit with the new\r\nperformance.measure extensions is that these tracks show up in the order\r\nthey're used which is not the order of priority that we use.

Therefore, I think in a follow up I'll actually instead switch to a\r\nmodel where Components is a single track regardless of lane since we\r\ndon't currently have overlap anyway. Then the description about what is\r\nactually rendering can be separate lanes.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-15 at 10 55 55슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ca3fa74-97ce-40c7-97f7-80c1dd7d6470\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-15 at 10 56 27슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557ad65b-4190-465f-843c-0bc6cbb9326d\">",

      "message": "[compiler] Factor out function effects from reference effects\n\nSummary:\nThis PR performs a major refactor of InferReferenceEffects to separate out the work on marking places with Effects from inferring FunctionEffects. The behavior should be identical after this change (see [internal sync](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/everpaste/?handle=GN74VxscnUaztTYDAL8q0CRWBIxibsIXAAAB)) but the FunctionEffect logic should be easier to work with.\n\nThese analyses are unfortunately still deeply linked--the FunctionEffect analysis needs to reason about the \"current\" value kind for each point in the program, while the InferReferenceEffects algorithm performs global updates on the state of the program (e.g. freezing). In the future, it might be possible to make these entirely separate passes if we store the ValueKind directly on places.\n\nFor the most part, the logic of reference effects and function effects can be cleanly separated: for each instruction and terminal, we visit its places and infer their effects, and then we visit its places and infer any function effects that they cause. The biggest wrinkle here is that when a transitive function freeze operation occurs, it has to happen *after* inferring the function effects on the place, because otherwise we may convert a value from Context to Frozen, which will cause the ContextualMutation function effect to be converted to a ReactMutation effect too early. This can be observed in a case like this:\n\n```\nexport default component C() {\n  foo(() => {\n    const p = {};\n    return () => {\n      p['a'] = 1\n    };\n  });\n}\n```\nHere when the outer function returns the inner function, it freezes the inner function which transitively freezes `p`. But before that freeze happens, we need to replay the ContextualMutation on the inner function to determine that the value is mutable in the outer context. If we froze `p` first, we would instead convert the ContextualMutation to a ReactMutation and error.\n\nTo handle this, InferReferenceEffects now delays the exection of the freezeValue action until after it's called the helper functions that generate function effects. So the order of operations on a given place is now\n\nset effect --> generate function effects --> transitively freeze dependencies, if applicable\n\nghstack-source-id: 21cb50c14054e7e7a307acb595ef30b54c2f2a52\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30920",

      "message": "[compiler][rewrite] PropagateScopeDeps hir rewrite\n\nResubmission of #30079 -- core logic unchanged, but needed to rebase past #30573\n\n### Quick background\n#### Temporaries\n\nThe compiler currently treats temporaries and named variables (e.g. `x`) differently in this pass.\n- named variables may be reassigned (in fact, since we're running after LeaveSSA, a single named identifier's IdentifierId may map to multiple `Identifier` instances -- each with its own scope and mutable range)\n- temporaries are replaced with their represented expressions during codegen. This is correct (mostly correct, see #29878) as we're careful to always lower the correct evaluation semantics. However, since we rewrite reactive scopes entirely (to if/else blocks), we need to track temporaries that a scope produces in `ReactiveScope.declarations` and later promote them to named variables.\nIn the same example, $4, $5, and $6 need to be promoted: $2 ->`t0`,  $5 ->`t1`, and $6 ->`t2`.\n```js\n[1] $2 = LoadGlobal(global) foo\n[2] $3 = LoadLocal bar$1\nscope 0:\n  [3] $4 = Call $2(<unknown> $3)\nscope 1:\n  [4] $5 = Object {  }\nscope 2:\n  [5] $6 = Object { a: $4, b: $5 }\n[6] $8 = StoreLocal Const x$7 = $6\n```\n\n#### Dependencies\n`ReactiveScope.dependencies` records the set of (read-only) values that a reactive scope is dependent on. This is currently limited to just variables (named variables from source and promoted temporaries) and property-loads.\nAll dependencies we record need to be hoistable -- i.e. reordered to just before the ReactiveScope begins. Not all PropertyLoads are hoistable.\n\nIn this example, we should not evaluate `obj.a.b` without before creating x and checking `objIsNull`.\n```js\n// reduce-reactive-deps/no-uncond.js\nfunction useFoo({ obj, objIsNull }) {\n  const x = [];\n  if (isFalse(objIsNull)) {\n    x.push(obj.a.b);\n  }\n  return x;\n}\n```\n\nWhile other memoization strategies with different constraints exist, the current compiler requires that `ReactiveScope.dependencies` be re-orderable to the beginning of the reactive scope. But.. `PropertyLoad`s from null values will throw `TypeError`. This means that evaluating hoisted dependencies should throw if and only if the source program throws. (It is also a bug if source throws and compiler output does not throw. See https://github.com/facebook/react-forget/pull/2709)\n\n---\n### Rough high level overview\n1. Pass 1\nWalk over instructions to gather every temporary used outside of its defining scope (same as ReactiveFunction version). These determine the sidemaps we produce, as temporaries used outside of their declaring scopes get promoted to named variables later (and are not considered hoistable rvals).\n2. Pass 2 (collectTemporariesSidemap)\nWalk over instructions to generate a sidemap of temporary identifier -> named variable and property path (e.g. `$3 -> {obj: props, path: [\"a\", \"b\"]}`)\n2. Pass 2 (collectHoistablePropertyLoads)\n  a. Build a sidemap of block -> accessed variables and properties (e.g. `bb0 -> [ {obj: props, path: [\"a\", \"b\"]} ]`)\n  b. Propagate \"non-nullness\" i.e. variables and properties for which we can safely evaluate `PropertyLoad`.\n  A basic block can unconditionally read from identifier X if any of the following applies:\n    - the block itself reads from identifier X\n    - all predecessors of the block read from identifier X\n    - all successors of the block read from identifier X\n4. Pass 3: (collectDependencies)\nWalks over instructions again to record dependencies and declarations, using the previously produced sidemaps. We do not record any control-flow here\n5. Merge every scope's recorded dependencies with the set of hoistable PropertyLoads\n\nTested by syncing internally and (1) checking compilation output differences ([internal link](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/everpaste/?handle=GPCfUBt_HCoy_S4EAJDVFJyJJMR0bsIXAAAB)), running internally e2e tests ([internal link](https://fburl.com/sandcastle/cs5mlkxq))\n\n---\n### Followups:\n1. Rewrite function expression deps\nThis change produces much more optimal output as the compiler now uses the function CFG to understand which variables / paths are assumed to be non-null. However, it may exacerbate [this function-expr hoisting bug](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/__tests__/fixtures/compiler/bug-invalid-hoisting-functionexpr.tsx). A short term fix here is to simply call some form of `collectNonNullObjects` on every function expression to find hoistable variable / paths. In the longer term, we should refactor out `FunctionExpression.deps`.\n\n2. Enable optional paths\n(a) don't count optional load temporaries as dependencies (e.g. `collectOptionalLoadRValues(...)`).\n(b) record optional paths in both collectHoistablePropertyLoads and dependency collection\n\nghstack-source-id: 2507f6ea751dce09ad1dccd353ae6fc7cf411582\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30894",

      "message": "[DevTools] Refactor Error / Warning Count Tracking (#30899)\n\nWe can simplify this tracking by not having a separate pending set of\r\nlogs and the logs tracked per instance and instead we just track the\r\nlogs per Fiber. This avoids the need to move it back into the pending\r\nset after unmounts in case a Fiber is reparented.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this is to unify with an upcoming tracking of\r\nlogs for Server Components. For those it doesn't make sense to move them\r\ninto a per instance set and because the same Server Component - and its\r\nlogs - may appear more than once. So no particular instance should steal\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this change is that instead of looking up the\r\ninstance from fiber, which requires the fiberToFiberInstanceMap, we\r\ninstead look up if a component has any new logs when we traverse it in\r\nthe commit phase. After all for a component to have had a log it must\r\nhave updated. This is a similar technique to #30897. This technique also\r\nworks for Server Components without having to maintain a one to many\r\nrelationship from ComponentInfo to VirtualInstance. So it unifies them.\r\n\r\nNormally this look up would be fast since the `fiberToComponentsLogs`\r\nset would be empty and so doesn't add any significant weight to the\r\ncommit phase. If there's a ton of logs on many different components then\r\nit's not great since it would slow down the commit phase but that's not\r\nwhat we expect to see so in typical usage, this is better.\r\n\r\nThere is an unfortunate consequence though which is that\r\n`console.warn/error` in passive effects (i.e. `useEffect`) wouldn't be\r\npicked up because currently we traverse the logs in\r\n`handleCommitFiberRoot` which is too early. If we moved that to\r\n`handlePostCommitFiberRoot` this wouldn't be a problem. In the meantime,\r\nI just detect this and do a brute force flush by walking all mounted\r\ninstances if there's a `console.warn/error` inside a passive effect.\r\n\r\nIf we ever add \"owners\" to event handlers that are triggered outside the\r\nrender/commit phases (like `<div onClick={...}>`) and we want to\r\nassociate error/warnings in those, we'd need a different technique to\r\nensure those get flushed in time.",

Critically this avoids the\r\nfiberToFiberInstance map to look up whether or not a Fiber should be\r\nforced to suspend when asked by the renderer.\r\n\r\nThis also allows us to force suspend/error on filtered instances. It's a\r\nbit unclear what should happen when you try to Suspend or Error a child\r\nbut its parent boundary is filtered. It was also inconsistent between\r\nSuspense and Error due to how they were implemented.\r\n\r\nI think conceptually you're trying to simulate what would happen if that\r\nComponent errored or suspended so it would be misleading if we triggered\r\na different boundary than would happen in real life.

However I also eagerly walk the\r\ntree at first to find whether we have any Suspense or Error boundary\r\nparents at all so we can hide the buttons if not.\r\n\r\nThis also implements it to work with VirtualInstances using #30865. I\r\nfind the nearest Fiber Instance downwards filtered or otherwise. Then\r\nfrom its parent we find the nearest Error or Suspense boundary. That's\r\nbecause VirtualInstance will always have their inner Fiber as an\r\nInstance but they might not have their parent since it might be\r\nfiltered.

      "message": "[Flight] Ship DEV-only enableServerComponentLogs flag in Stable/Canary (#30847)\n\nTo recap. This only affects DEV and RSC. It patches console on the\r\nserver in DEV (similar to how React DevTools already does and what we\r\ndid for the double logging). Then replays those logs with a `[Server]`\r\nbadge on the client so you don't need a server terminal open.\r\n\r\nThis has been on for over 6 months now in our experimental channel and\r\nwe've had a lot of coverage in Next.js due to various experimental flags\r\nlike taint and ppr.\r\n\r\nIt's non-invasive in that even if something throws we just serialize\r\nthat as an unknown value.\r\n\r\nThe main feedback we've gotten was:\r\n\r\n- The serialization depth wasn't deep enough which I addressed in #30294\r\nand haven't really had any issues since. This could still be an issue or\r\nthe inverse that you serialize too many logs that are also too deep.\r\nThis is not so much an issue with intentional logging and things like\r\naccidental errors don't typically have unbounded arguments (e.g. React\r\nerrors are always string arguments). The ideal would be some way to\r\nretain objects and then load them on-demand but that needs more\r\nplumbing. Which can be later.\r\n- The other was that double logging on the server is annoying if the\r\nsame terminal does both the RSC render and SSR render which was\r\naddressed in #30207. It is now off by default in node/edge-builds of the\r\nclient, on by default in browser builds. With the `replayConsole` option\r\nto either opt-in or out.\r\n\r\nWe've reached a good spot now I think.\r\n\r\nThese are better with `enableOwnerStacks` but that's a separate track\r\nand not needed.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to document here, other than maybe that we're doing it,\r\nis the `replayConsole` option but that's part of the RSC renderers that\r\nthemselves are not documented so nowhere to document it.",

What existing problem\r\ndoes the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen debugging applications that are experiencing runaway re-rendering,\r\nit is helpful to profile them in the React Developer Tools.\r\nUnfortunately there is a size limit on the captured profile which can\r\nmake them impossible to inspect or save. The limitations I have found\r\nare in `postMessage` for the Chrome extension and in the `ws` websocket\r\nserver for the standalone app.\r\n\r\nProfiling an app that produces a large profile artifact will simply show\r\nthat no profiling data was captured and output an error in the console,\r\nhere shown for the standalone app:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nstandalone.js:92 [React DevTools] Error with websocket connection i맡target: H, type: 'error', message: 'Max payload size exceeded', error: RangeError: Max payload size exceeded\r\n    at e.exports.haveLength (/Users/rune/.npm/_npx/8ea6ac5c50뵿error: RangeError: Max payload size exceeded\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change simply increases the max payload of the websocket server in\r\nthe standalone app so that larger profiles may be captured and\r\ninspected.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDemonstrate the code is solid.

      "message": "[wip][compiler] Infer optional dependencies\n\nUpdates PropagateScopeDeps and DeriveMinimalDeps to understand optional dependency paths (`a?.b`). There a few key pieces to this:\n\nIn PropagateScopeDeps we jump through some hoops to work around the awkward structure of nested OptionalExpressions. This is much easier in HIR form, but I managed to get this pretty close and i think it will be landable with further cleanup. A good chunk of this is avoiding prematurely registering a value as a dependency - there are a bunch of indirections in the ReactiveFunction structure:\n\n```\nt0 = OptionalExpression\n  SequenceExpression\n    t0 = Sequence\n      ...\n    LoadLocal t0\n```\n\nWhere if at any point we call `visitOperand()` we'll prematurely register a dependency instead of declareProperty(). The other bit is that optionals can be optional=false for nested member expressions where not all the parts are actually optional (`foo.bar?.bar.call()`). And of course, parts of an optional chain can still be conditional even when optional=true (for example the `x` in `foo.bar?.[x]?.baz`). Not all of this is tested yet so there are likely bugs still.\n\nThe other bit is DeriveMinimalDeps, which is thankfully easier. We add OptionalAccess and OptionalDep and update the merge and reducing logic for these cases. There is probably still more to update though, for things like merging subtrees. There are a lot of ternaries that assume a result can be exactly one of two states (conditional/unconditional, dependency/access) and these assumptions don't hold anymore. I'd like to refactor to dependency/access separate from conditional/optional/unconditional. Also, the reducing logic isn't quite right: once a child is optional we keep inferring all the parents as optional too, losing some precision. I need to adjust the reducing logic to let children decide whether their path token is optional or not.\n\nghstack-source-id: 207842ac64560cf0f93ec96eb9ae1f17c62493ac\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30819",

Unfortunately Node.js doesn't expose V8's API\r\nto get a source location of a function.\r\n\r\nWe do have the owner stacks of the JSX that created it though and at\r\nsome point we'll also show that location in DevTools.\r\n\r\nHowever, the realization is that if a Server Component is the owner of\r\nany child. The owner stack of that child will have the owner component's\r\nsource location as its bottom stack frame.\r\n\r\nThe technique I'm implementing here is to track whenever a child mounts\r\nwe already have its owner. We track the first discovered owned child's\r\nstack on the owner. Then when we ask for a Source location of the owner\r\ndo we parse that stack and extract the location of the bottom frame.\r\nThis doesn't give us a location necessarily in the top of the function\r\nbut somewhere in the function.\r\n\r\nIn this case the first owned child is the Container:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1107\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 10 24 42슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95f32850-24a5-4151-8ce6-b7b89db68aee\">\r\n<img width=\"648\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 10 24 20슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bcba033-866f-4684-9beb-de09d189deff\">\r\n\r\nWe can even use this technique for Fibers too.

This case is actually\r\nquite common:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Foo() {\r\n  return <Bar />;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, for Fibers we could really just use the `inspect(function)`\r\ntechnique which works for all cases. At least in Chrome.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this technique doesn't work if a Component doesn't create\r\nany new JSX but just renders its children. It also currently doesn't\r\nwork if the child is filtered since I only look up the owner if an\r\ninstance is not filtered. This means that the container in the fixture\r\ncan't view source by default since the host component is filtered:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default function Container({children}) {\r\n  return <div>{children}</div>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1107\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 10 24 35슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f8f9c5-5add-4d35-9290-3a5079e82adc\">",

Update InferTypes to infer the type of `phi.id.type`, not the unused `phi.type`.\n2. Update the algorithm to verify that all the phi types are actually equal, not just have the same kind.\n3. Handle circular types by removing the cycle.\n\nHowever, that reveals another issue: InferMutableRanges currently infers the results of `Store` effects _after_ its fixpoint loop. That was fine when a Store could never occur on a phi (since they wouldn't have a type to get a function signature from). Now though, we can have Store effects occur on phis, and we need to ensure that this correctly updates the mutable range of the phi operands - recursively. See new test that fails without the fixpoint loop.\n\nghstack-source-id: 2e1b02844d3a814dce094b7e3812df799e54343f\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30796",

The function is passed the name of the imported module (the RHS of the import stmt) and can return a TypeConfig, which is a recursive type of the following form:\n\n* Object of valid identifier keys (or \"*\" for wildcard) and values that are TypeConfigs\n* Function with various properties, whose return type is a TypeConfig\n* or a reference to a builtin type using one of a small list (currently Ref, Array, MixedReadonly, Primitive)\n\nRather than have to eagerly supply all known types (most of which may not be used) when creating the config, this function can do so lazily. During InferTypes we call `getGlobalDeclaration()` to resolve global types. Originally this was just for known react modules, but if the new config option is passed we also call it to see if it can resolve a type. For `import {name} from 'module'` syntax, we first resolve the module type and then call `getPropertyType(moduleType, 'name')` to attempt to retrieve the property of the module (the module would obviously have to be typed as an object type for this to have a chance of yielding a result). If the module type is returned as null, or the property doesn't exist, we fall through to the original checking of whether the name was hook-like.\n\nTODO:\n* testing\n* cache the results of modules so we don't have to re-parse/install their types on each LoadGlobal of the same module\n* decide what to do if the module types are invalid. probably better to fatal rather than bail out, since this would indicate an invalid configuration.\n\nghstack-source-id: bfdbf67e3dd0cbfd511bed0bd6ba92266cf99ab8\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30771",

      "message": "[compiler] Transitively freezing functions marks values as frozen, not effects\n\nThe fixture from the previous PR was getting inconsistent behavior because of the following:\n1. Create an object in a useMemo\n2. Create a callback in a useCallback, where the callback captures the object from (1) into a local object, then passes that local object into a logging method. We have to assume the logging method could modify the local object, and transitively, the object from (1).\n3. Call the callback during render.\n4. Pass the callback to JSX.\n\nWe correctly infer that the object from (1) is captured and modified in (2). However, in (4) we transitively freeze the callback. When transitively freezing functions we were previously doing two things: updating our internal abstract model of the program values to reflect the values as being frozen *and* also updating function operands to change their effects to freeze.\n\nAs the case above demonstrates, that can clobber over information about real potential mutability. The potential fix here is to only walk our abstract value model to mark values as frozen, but _not_ override operand effects. Conceptually, this is a forward data flow propagation  but walking backward to update effects is pushing information backwards in the algorithm. An alternative would be to mark that data was propagated backwards, and trigger another loop over the CFG to propagate information forward again given the updated effects. But the fix in this PR is more correct.\n\nghstack-source-id: c05e716f37827cb5515a059a1f0e8e8ff94b91df\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30766",

      "message": "[compiler] Repro for missing memoization due to inferred mutation\n\nThis fixture bails out on ValidatePreserveExistingMemo but would ideally memoize since the original memoization is safe. It's trivial to make it pass by commenting out the commented line (`LogEvent.log(() => object)`). I would expect the compiler to infer this as possible mutation of `logData`, since `object` captures a reference to `logData`. But somehow `logData` is getting memoized successfully, but we still infer the callback, `setCurrentIndex`, as having a mutable range that extends to the `setCurrentIndex()` call after the useCallback.\n\nghstack-source-id: 4f82e345102f82f6da74de3f9014af263d016762\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30764",

      "message": "[Flight] Source Map Server Actions to their Server Location (#30741)\n\nThis uses a similar technique to what we use to generate fake stack\r\nframes for server components. This generates an eval:ed wrapper function\r\naround the Server Reference proxy we create on the client. This wrapper\r\nfunction gets the original `name` of the action on the server and I also\r\nadd a source map if `findSourceMapURL` is defined that points back to\r\nthe source of the server function.\r\n\r\nFor `\"use server\"` on the server, there's no new API. It just uses the\r\ncallsite of `registerServerReference()` on the Server. We can infer the\r\nfunction name from the actual function on the server and we already have\r\nthe `findSourceMapURL` on the client receiving it.\r\n\r\nFor `\"use server\"` imported from the client, there's two new options\r\nadded to `createServerReference()` (in addition to the optional\r\n[`encodeFormAction`](#27563)). These are only used in DEV mode. The\r\n[`findSourceMapURL`](#29708) option is the same one added in #29708. We\r\nneed to pass this these references aren't created in the context of any\r\nspecific request but globally. The other weird thing about this case is\r\nthat this is actually a case where the compiled environment is the\r\nclient so any source maps are the same as for the client layer, so the\r\nenvironment name here is just `\"Client\"`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  createServerReference(\r\n    id: string,\r\n    callServer: CallServerCallback,\r\n    encodeFormAction?: EncodeFormActionCallback,\r\n+   findSourceMapURL?: FindSourceMapURLCallback, // DEV-only\r\n+   functionName?: string, // DEV-only\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key is that we use the location of the\r\n`registerServerReference()`/`createServerReference()` call as the\r\nlocation of the function. A compiler can either emit those at the same\r\nlocations as the original functions or use source maps to have those\r\nsegments refer to the original location of the function (or in the case\r\nof a re-export the original location of the re-export is also a fine\r\napproximate). The compiled output must call these directly without a\r\nwrapper function because the wrapper adds a stack frame. I decided\r\nagainst complicated and fragile dev-only options to skip n number of\r\nframes that would just end up in prod code. The implementation just\r\nskips one frame - our own. Otherwise it'll just point all source mapping\r\nto the wrapper.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a `\"use server\"` imported from the client implementation\r\nin the reference implementation/fixture so it's a bit tricky to test\r\nthat. In the case of CJS on the server, we just use a runtime instead of\r\ncompiler so it's tricky to source map those appropriately. We can\r\nimplement it for ESM on the server which is the main thing we're testing\r\nin the fixture. It's easier in a real implementation where all the\r\ncompilation is just one pass. It's a little tricky since we have to\r\nparse and append to other source maps but I'd like to do that as a\r\nfollow up. Or maybe that's just an exercise for the reader.\r\n\r\nYou can right click an action and click \"Go to Definition\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1323\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-17 at 6 04 27슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94d379b3-8871-4671-a20d-cbf9cfbc2c6e\">\r\n\r\nFor now they simply don't point to the right place but you can still\r\njump to the right file in the fixture:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-17 at 5 58 40슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea5d665-e25a-44ca-9515-481dd3c5c2fe\">\r\n\r\nIn Firefox/Safari given that the location doesn't exist in the source\r\nmap yet, the browser refuses to open the file.

      "message": "[DevTools] Find owners from the parent path that matches the Fiber or ReactComponentInfo (#30717)\n\nThis enables finding Server Components on the owner path. Server\r\nComponents aren't stateful so there's not actually one specific owner\r\nthat it necessarily matches. So it can't be a global look up. E.g. the\r\nsame Server Component can be rendered in two places or even nested\r\ninside each other.\r\n\r\nTherefore we need to find an appropriate instance using a heuristic. We\r\ncan do that by traversing the parent path since the owner is likely also\r\na parent. Not always but almost always.\r\n\r\nTo simplify things we can also do the same for Fibers. That brings us\r\none step closer to being able to get rid of the global\r\nfiberToFiberInstance map since we can just use the shadow tree to find\r\nthis information.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that we can't find owners that aren't parents which is\r\nusually ok. However, there is a test case that's interesting where you\r\nhave a React ART tree inside a DOM tree. In that case the owners\r\nactually span multiple renderers and roots so the owner is not on the\r\nparent stack. Usually this is fine since you'd just care about the\r\nowners within React ART but ideally we'd support this. However, I think\r\nthat really the fix to this is that the React ART tree itself should\r\nactually show up inside the DOM tree in DevTools and in the virtual\r\nshadow tree because that's conceptually where it belongs. That would\r\nthen solve this particular issue. We'd just need some way to associate\r\nthe root with a DOM parent when it gets mounted.",

      "message": "[DevTools] Support Server Components in Tree (#30684)\n\nThis adds VirtualInstances to the tree. Each Fiber has a list of its\r\nparent Server Components in `_debugInfo`. The algorithm is that when we\r\nenter a set of fibers, we actually traverse level 0 of all the\r\n`_debugInfo` in each fiber. Then level 1 of each `_debugInfo` and so on.\r\nIt would be simpler if `_debugInfo` only contained Server Component\r\nsince then we could just look at the index in the array but it actually\r\ncontains other data as well which leads to multiple passes but we don't\r\nexpect it to have a lot of levels before hitting a reified fiber.\r\nFinally when we hit the end a traverse the fiber itself.\r\n\r\nThis lets us match consecutive `ReactComponentInfo` that are all the\r\nsame at the same level. This creates a single VirtualInstance for each\r\nsequence. This lets the same Server Component instance that's a parent\r\nto multiple children appear as a single Instance instead of one per\r\nFiber.\r\n\r\nSince a Server Component's result can be rendered in more than one place\r\nthere's not a 1:1 mapping though. If it is in different parents or if\r\nthe sequence is interrupted, then it gets split into two different\r\ninstances with the same `ReactComponentInfo` data.\r\n\r\nThe real interesting case is what happens during updates because this\r\nalgorithm means that a Fiber can become reparented during an update to\r\nend up in a different VirtualInstance. The ideal would maybe be that the\r\nfrontend could deal with this reparenting but instead I basically just\r\nunmount the previous instance (and its children) and mount a new\r\ninstance which leads to some interesting scenarios. This is inline with\r\nthe strategy I was intending to pursue anyway where instances are\r\nreconciled against the previous children of the same parent instead of\r\nthe `fiberToFiberInstance` map - which would let us get rid of that map.\r\nIn that case the model is resilient to Fiber being in more than one\r\nplace at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever this unmount/remount does mean that we can lose selection when\r\nthis happens. We could maybe do something like using the tracked path\r\nlike I did for component filters. Ideally it's a weird edge case though\r\nbecause you'd typically not have it. The main case that it happens now\r\nis for reorders of list of server components. In that case basically all\r\nthe children move between server components while the server components\r\nthemselves stay in place. We should really include the key in server\r\ncomponents so that we can reconcile them using the key to handle\r\nreorders which would solve the common case anyway.\r\n\r\nI convert the name to the `Env(Name)` pattern which allows the\r\nEnvironment Name to be used as a badge.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1105\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-13 at 9 55 29슗M\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323c20ba-b655-4ee8-84fa-8233f55d2999\">\r\n\r\n(Screenshot is with #30667.

I.e. to track the last message and only send after we get a\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nI still keep the throttle to persist the selection since that affects\r\nthe disk usage and doesn't have direct UX effects.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this change though is that lodash throttle\r\ndoesn't rely on timers but Date.now which makes it incompatible with\r\nmost jest helpers which means I can't write tests against these\r\nfunctions properly.",

      "message": "[DevTools] Build up DevTools Instance Shadow Tree (#30625)\n\nThis is the beginning of a refactor of the DevTools Fiber backend. The\r\nnew approach is basically that we listen to each commit from Fiber and\r\ntraverse the tree - building up a filtered shadow tree. Then we send\r\ndiffs based on that tree and perform our own operations against that\r\ninstead of using Fibers as the source of truth.\r\n\r\nFiber diffs Elements -> Fibers. The backend diffs Fibers ->\r\nDevToolsInstances as a side-effect it sends deltas to the front end.\r\n\r\nThis makes the algorithm resilient to a different Fiber implementation\r\nthat doesn't use pairs of Fibers (alternates) but instead stateless new\r\nclones each time. In that world we can't treat Fibers as instances. They\r\ncan hold onto instances but they're not necessarily 1:1 themselves.\r\n\r\nThe same thing also applies to Server Components that don't have their\r\nown instances.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is more or less the same as React's reconciliation in\r\nReactChildFiber itself. However, we do a mutable update of the tree as\r\nwe go. We also cheat a bit here in the first version in that we still\r\nhave fiberToFiberInstance map and alternate which makes reorders easier.\r\nFurther down we could do the reorders by adding the previous set to a\r\ntemporary map like ChildFiber does but only if they're not already in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThis first bit is just about making sure that we produce correct trees.\r\nWe have fairly good test coverage already of that already.\r\n\r\nIn the next few follow ups I'll start simplifying the rest of the logic\r\nby taking advantage of the new tree.",

      "message": "[compiler] Stay in SSA form through entire pipeline\n\nThis PR updates to use SSA form through the entire compilation pipeline. This means that in both HIR form and ReactiveFunction form, `Identifier` instances map 1:1 to `IdentifierId` values. If two identifiers have the same IdentifierId, they are the same instance. What this means is that all our passes can use this more precise information to determine if two particular identifiers are not just the same variable, but the same SSA \"version\" of that variable.\n\nHowever, some parts of our analysis really care about program variables as opposed to SSA versions, and were relying on LeaveSSA to reset identifiers such that all Identifier instances for a particular program variable would have the same IdentifierId (though not necessarily the same Identifier instance). With LeaveSSA removed, those analysis passes can now use DeclarationId instead to uniquely identify a program variable.\n\nNote that this PR surfaces some opportunties to improve edge-cases around reassigned values being declared/reassigned/depended-upon across multiple scopes. Several passes could/should use IdentifierId to more precisely identify exactly which values are accessed - for example, a scope that reassigns `x` but doesn't use `x` prior to reassignment doesn't have to take a dependency on `x`. But today we take a dependnecy.\n\nMy approach for these cases was to add a \"TODO LeaveSSA\" comment with notes and the name of the fixture demonstrating the difference, but to intentionally preserve the existing behavior (generally, switching to use DeclarationId when IdentifierId would have been more precise).\n\nBeyond updating passes to use DeclarationId instead of Identifier/IdentifierId, the other change here is to extract out the remaining necessary bits of LeaveSSA into a new pass that rewrites InstructionKind (const/let/reassign/etc) based on whether a value is actually const or has reassignments and should be let.\n\nghstack-source-id: 69afdaee5fadf3fdc98ce97549da805f288218b4\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30573",

That works because it uses the same mechanism\r\nas event dispatching and those need to be able to receive events.\r\nHowever, you can't select a resource. Because that's conceptually one to\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nThis keeps track of which fiber is acquiring which resource so we can\r\nfind all the corresponding instances.\r\n\r\nE.g. now you can select the `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` in the Flight\r\nfixture in the Element panel and then the component that rendered it in\r\nthe Components panel will be selected.\r\n\r\nIf we had a concept multi-selection we could potentially select all of\r\nthem. This similar to how a Server Component can be rendered in more\r\nthan one place and if we want to select all matching ones. It's kind of\r\nweird though and both cases are edge cases.\r\n\r\nNotably imperative preloads do have elements that don't have any\r\ncorresponding component but that's ok.

Resources are a bit\r\nspecial because they're a DOM specific type but we can expect any other\r\nimplementation using resources to provide and instance on this field if\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThere's a slightly related case for the reverse lookup. You can already\r\nselect a singleton or hoistable (that's not a resource) in the browser\r\nelements panel and it'll select the corresponding node in the RDT\r\nComponents panel. That works because it uses the same mechanism as event\r\ndispatching and those need to be able to receive events.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can't select a resource. Because that's conceptually one to\r\nmany. We could in principle just search the tree for the first one or\r\nkeep a map of currently mounted resources and just pick the first fiber\r\nthat created it.

      "message": "[DevTools] Make Element Inspection Feel Snappy (#30555)\n\nThere's two problems. The biggest one is that it turns out that Chrome\r\nis throttling looping timers that we're using both while polling and for\r\nbatching bridge traffic. This means that bridge traffic a lot of the\r\ntime just slows down to 1 second at a time. No wonder it feels sluggish.\r\nThe only solution is to not use timers for this.\r\n\r\nEven when it doesn't like in Firefox the batching into 100ms still feels\r\ntoo sluggish.\r\n\r\nThe fix I use is to batch using a microtask instead so we can still\r\nbatch multiple commands sent in a single event but we never artificially\r\nslow down an interaction.\r\n\r\nI don't think we've reevaluated this for a long time since this was in\r\nthe initial commit of DevTools to this repo. If it causes other issues\r\nwe can follow up on those.\r\n\r\nWe really shouldn't use timers for debouncing and such. In fact, React\r\nitself recommends against it because we have a better technique with\r\nscheduling in Concurrent Mode. The correct way to implement this in the\r\nbridge is using a form of back-pressure where we don't keep sending\r\nmessages until we get a message back and only send the last one that\r\nmatters. E.g. when moving the cursor over a the elements tab we\r\nshouldn't let the backend one-by-one move the DOM node to each one we\r\nhave ever passed. We should just move to the last one we're currently\r\nhovering over. But this can't be done at the bridge layer since it\r\ndoesn't know if it's a last-one-wins or imperative operation where each\r\none needs to be sent. It needs to be done higher. I'm not currently\r\nseeing any perf problems with this new approach but I'm curious on React\r\nNative or some thing. RN might need the back-pressure approach. That can\r\nbe a follow up if we ever find a test case.\r\n\r\nFinally, the other problem is that we use a Suspense boundary around the\r\nElement Inspection. Suspense boundaries are for things that are expected\r\nto take a long time to load. This shows a loading state immediately. To\r\navoid flashing when it ends up being fast, React throttles the reveal to\r\n200ms. This means that we take a minimum of 200ms to show the props. The\r\nway to show fast async data in React is using a Transition (either using\r\nstartTransition or useDeferredValue). This lets the old value remaining\r\nin place while we're loading the next one.\r\n\r\nWe already implement this using `inspectedElementID` which is the async\r\none. It would be more idiomatic to implement this with useDeferredValue\r\nrather than the reducer we have now but same principle. We were just\r\nusing the wrong ID in a few places so when it synchronously updated they\r\nsuspended. So I just made them use the inspectedElementID instead.\r\n\r\nThen I can simply remove the Suspense boundary. Now the selection\r\nupdates in the tree view synchronously and the sidebar lags a frame or\r\ntwo but it feels instant. It doesn't flash to white between which is\r\nkey.",

      "message": "[compiler] More complete validation against locals being reassigned after render\n\nSummary:\nThis diff extends the existing work on validating against locals being reassigned after render, by propagating the reassignment \"effect\" into the lvalues of instructions when the rvalue operands include values known to cause reassignments. In particular, this \"closes the loop\" for function definitions and function calls: a function that returns a function that reassigns will be considered to also perform reassignments, but previous to this we didn't consider the result of a `Call` of a function that reassigns to itself be a value that reassigns.\n\nThis causes a number of new bailouts in test cases, all of which appear to me to be legit.\n\nghstack-source-id: 770bf02d079ea2480be243a49caa6f69573d8092\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30540",

This is now\r\nsplit into a FiberInstance (Client Component) and a VirtualInstance\r\n(Server Component). We're not actually creating any VirtualInstances yet\r\nthough this is just the data structures.\r\n\r\nServer Components and potentially other compiled away or runtime\r\noptimized away (e.g. calling through a function without creating an\r\nintermediate Fiber) don't have a stateful instance. They just represent\r\nthe latest data. It's kind of like a React Element.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the DevTools UI we need them to be stateful partly just so\r\nthat you can select and refer to them separately. E.g. the same Server\r\nComponent output rendered into different slots on the client should\r\nstill have two different representations in the DevTools. Also if the\r\nsame child Fibers update in place because the Server Component refreshed\r\nwe shouldn't lose the selection if you've selected a Server Component.\r\n\r\nI'll implement this by creating Virtual Instances that only exist for\r\nthe purpose of the DevTools UI and so it'll be implemented in the\r\nDevTools.\r\n\r\nWe could just make a Map from `id` to `Fiber | ReactComponentInfo` but\r\nthat requires a branching without a consistent hidden class. We also\r\nneed some more states on there. We also have some other Maps that tracks\r\nextra states like that of component stacks, errors and warnings.\r\nConstantly resizing and adding/removing from a Map isn't exactly fast.\r\nIt's faster to have a single Map with an object in it than one Map per\r\nobject. However, having extra fields that are usually just `null` can\r\ninstead mean more memory gets used. Since only a very small fraction of\r\ninstances will have errors/warnings or having initialized its component\r\nstack, it made sense to store that in a separate Map that is usually\r\njust empty.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the addition of particularly the `parent` field and the\r\nability to do a fast hidden-class safe branching on the `kind` field I\r\nthink it's probably worth actually allocating an extra first class\r\nobject per Instance to store DevTools state into. That's why I converted\r\nfrom just storing `Fiber` -> `id` to storing `Fiber` ->\r\n`DevToolsInstance` which then keeps the warnings/errors/componentStack\r\nas extra fields that are usually `null`. That is a lot of objects though\r\nsince it's one per Fiber pair basically.",

However, when multiple renderers\r\nare nested there can be multiple ancestors. The original fix #24665 did\r\nthis by taking the inner renderer if it was an exact match but if it\r\nwasn't it just took the first renderer.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can track the inner most node we've found so far. Then get\r\nthe ID from that node (which will be fast since it's now a perfect\r\nmatch). This is a better match.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main reason I'm doing this is because the old mechanism\r\nleaked the `Fiber` type outside the `RendererInterface` which is\r\nsupposed to abstract all of that. With the new algorithm this doesn't\r\nleak.\r\n\r\nI've tested this with a new build against the repro in the old issue\r\n#24539 and it seems to work.",
