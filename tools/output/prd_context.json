But, I really only have a short window to try and test (with TSO) whether we are correctly coding Google Analytics (GA) URLs. I am available to get on a call my-Sunday-night if that helps get to the core of the issue faster.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have GA set up to add utm params to urls with the domain [www.ticketmaster.com|http://www.ticketmaster.com]. I then also am inserting a system tag in the utm_campaign param....BUT....our system is adding a \"+\" at the end of that URL.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[https://m9.tm00.com/tmsubscribe.net/viewbcast.aspx?B=DVf0&N=Lao&T=1|https://m9.tm00.com/tmsubscribe.net/viewbcast.aspx?B=DVf0&N=Lao&T=1|smart-link] \n\n\u00a0\n\nI just removed the GA set-up utm_campaign to be a hard-coded \"TEST\", as opposed to the dynamic-tag of [billingcode]. I can confirm that when using \"TEST\" the link did NOT have the \"+\" added. So, I think the quick fix is to figure out why \"[billingcode]\" is not trimming itself (or is arbitrarily adding an apace or + to the end).\n\n!image-20250722-072604.png|width=1112,height=487,alt=\"image-20250722-072604.png\"!"
